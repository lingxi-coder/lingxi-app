# MobileLinux release contract

LingXi's Android or iOS combined distribution is GPLv3 when it includes the
OpenMinis-derived shell, PRoot, PTY bridge, or Alpine rootfs integration.
Original MIT and Apache-2.0 components retain their notices.

Native sources and toolchains belong to the Cargo-locked mobile Linux SDK;
Local Apps profiles belong to the Cargo-locked Harness. See
[RUNTIME-SOURCE-CONTRACT.md](RUNTIME-SOURCE-CONTRACT.md) for their resolvers,
artifact ownership and validation. The inherited component baseline includes:

- OpenMinis `9cf3a855fecd27bb5735b84cacbd56852a3ab8dd`
- OpenMinis PRoot fork `8cf13e997cdc9472997aae19df8050c073c9a86c`
- talloc 2.4.2
- Base MobileLinux rootfs: Alpine 3.21.3 for `arm64-v8a` and `x86_64`
- Local-app rootfs: Alpine 3.24.2; official Node `26.9.0` source built for musl,
  npm `12.0.2`, pnpm `12.5.1` with integrity-pinned platform executables,
  native TypeScript/LSP `7.0.2`, Vite `8.3.0`, Rolldown `1.2.9`,
  Lightning CSS `1.33.0`, and React/ReactDOM `19.3.0`.
- All apps use runtime profile revision 4 with the current Node/pnpm toolchain.
  Older template revisions and their toolchains are no longer supported.
  React Router remains at `6.30.6`, the latest compatible line for Ionic
  `9.0.4` (its router requires `<7`).

Android keeps one distribution dimension:

- `play` maps to **Store** and compiles out policy-sensitive high-risk offloads.
- `direct` maps to **Full** and compiles the complete permission-gated surface.

Both Android distributions use the PRoot MobileLinux runtime for Agent shell
commands and terminal sessions. A missing rootfs or unavailable runtime is
reported explicitly; there is no Android host-shell fallback.

## iOS (iSH ARM64)

iOS device builds use the pinned OpenMinis iSH ARM64 source and Alpine aarch64
fakefs rootfs. `apps/ios/native/scripts/build-linux-runtime.sh` reconstructs all
native-support framework and rootfs through the locked SDK; simulator slices
compile the same API and report unavailable without linking the iSH kernel.
Full local-app release builds pass `--local-app-runtime --apk-dir <closure>`;
that path validates the exact Node/Git closure before doing the expensive iSH
build and verifies the resulting rootfs package database before staging.

A `Full*` or `StoreDebug` **device** build also packages a resolved dependency tree, so the
first `create_local_app` on a device does not resolve the template's
packages over the network inside the emulated guest. The Xcode phase fails
closed when it is absent, so produce it first:

```text
scripts/local-apps/build-local-app-node-modules.sh --arch aarch64
apps/ios/native/scripts/stage-local-app-runtime.sh --variant full \
  --node-modules apps/ios/native/build/local-app-node-modules/aarch64/node_modules
```

The tree must be resolved **inside the rootfs**, which is what the first script
does: Vite runs under musl on the guest's Node, so the `*-linux-<arch>-musl`
native bindings are the ones that must be present. A host `pnpm install`
resolves the darwin bindings and is rejected during staging.

The engine adopts the staged tree by matching `runtime-manifest.json`'s
`pnpm_lock_sha256` against the app's own lockfile; an app whose lockfile has
drifted declines the seed and performs a real install instead.

The runtime is in-process Linux userspace emulation, not a Linux kernel or a
security boundary. Isolation remains the iOS app sandbox plus explicit fakefs
bind mounts. Release artifacts must include iSH's GPLv3 text, `LICENSE.IOS`,
the Alpine package notices/SBOM, and corresponding source for the exact pins.

Build and verification entrypoints:

```text
apps/android/native/scripts/verify-mobile-linux-pins.sh
apps/android/native/scripts/build-mobile-linux-native.sh --variant play
apps/android/native/scripts/build-mobile-linux-native.sh --variant direct
apps/android/native/scripts/verify-mobile-linux-native.sh --variant <play|direct>
apps/android/native/scripts/stage-mobile-linux-assets.sh --variant <play|direct> --input <evidence> --apk-dir <closure>
apps/android/native/scripts/verify-local-app-supply-chain.sh [--release --apk-dir <closure>]
apps/ios/native/scripts/verify-local-app-supply-chain.sh [--release --apk-dir <closure>]
```

The local-app release check is fail-closed. Native ARM64 builds verify the
source-built Node binary and the exact installed tool versions. The x86_64
closure retains its recorded Rosetta limitation and the source-built Node path
must also be verified on an x86_64 or qemu-backed host before release readiness.
Node ARM64/musl on iSH is not an upstream Tier 1 platform: device smoke testing
is required independently of native Linux compilation.

The staging scripts accept only a host-prepared `node_modules` tree containing
the exact Linux musl Rolldown, Lightning CSS, and Tailwind Oxide bindings for
ARM64 and x86_64. They reject
package manager binaries, escaping symlinks, and any top-level `next` or
`@next` drift, emit a per-file SHA-256 manifest, and stage immutable files for
the runtime's read-only mount.

Native and rootfs outputs are generated under gitignored build/output
directories. Reference-tree `.so`, loader, and rootfs binaries are never copied
into a product artifact. `build-mobile-linux-native.sh` reconstructs PRoot,
its unbundled loader and network-policy launcher from pinned SDK source, then
builds the product UniFFI library for both supported ABIs.

A release evidence directory contains, per ABI:

```text
<abi>/<rootfs archive named by rootfs-manifest.json>
<abi>/rootfs-manifest.json
<abi>/rootfs-build.lock.json
<abi>/rootfs.spdx.json
<abi>/executable-allowlist.json
```

The official minirootfs digest in `rootfs.archives` remains the immutable
source pin. The shipped archive is the deterministic, package-augmented
rootfs, so it needs a committed digest of its own in
`rootfs.release_archives.<abi>.sha256`; staging refuses any ABI that has no
such pin rather than trust the hash the evidence directory issues for itself.

### KNOWN UNANCHORED STEP: no release archive digest is committed

`mobile-linux-pins.json` carries **no `rootfs.release_archives` key**, for
either ABI. Minting one requires a reproducible package-augmented rootfs, and
`local-app-runtime-pins.json` records `release_ready: false`: arm64 is complete,
while x86_64 remains blocked only on native offline-install verification. The
generic MobileLinux release archive also still needs its reproducible packaging
run and reviewed repository digest. These pins must not be invented from a
single local build or revised merely to route around the remaining gate.

So the shipped rootfs bytes have **no repository-committed anchor at all**. The
only guarantee today is a refusal: `stage-mobile-linux-assets.sh` aborts on its
first ABI with `no committed release rootfs digest for arm64-v8a`. That is a
documented gap, not coverage. Two things must not be misread as closing it:

- `verify-mobile-linux-pins.sh` succeeding. It validates the source pins and
  never opens a rootfs archive.
- The `verify-release-archive` cases in `test-local-app-supply-chain.sh`. All
  but the last drive **synthetic** pin fixtures; they prove the comparator
  works, not that a real digest exists. The last block is a known-gap anchor
  that asserts the committed pins file still has no digest.

Whoever unblocks the APK closure must, in the same change: build the archive
with `package-rootfs-release.sh`; confirm the two-pass determinism check in
`test-rootfs-tooling.sh` reproduces the digest byte-for-byte; cross-check it
against `rootfs-manifest.json`'s `archive.sha256`; commit it under
`rootfs.release_archives.<abi>.sha256`; and convert the known-gap anchor at the
end of `test-local-app-supply-chain.sh` into a positive match assertion. That
anchor is written to fail the moment a digest appears, so this section cannot
silently go stale.

Once a pin exists, staging verifies the archive bytes against it, against its
own manifest and lock, and against the archive policy before copying assets
under `app/build/generated/mobileLinux/<play|direct>/assets`. Gradle stores
`.gz` and `.zst` assets without recompression, preserving the release hash.

Release deliverables must also include:

- `LICENSES/NOTICE.md` and the exact GPL/LGPL texts;
- `sbom/mobile-linux.spdx.json` plus the generated per-rootfs SBOM;
- complete corresponding source or a durable corresponding-source offer;
- all Android/Gradle dependency notices and the Alpine package-license list.

The former authorization documents remain as historical migration records.
The distribution choice is now GPLv3; they are no longer a substitute for the
source, notice, and SBOM release gates described above.
