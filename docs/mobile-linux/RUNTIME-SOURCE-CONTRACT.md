# Mobile runtime source boundary

The runtime Git revision pinned by Cargo owns `docs/mobile-linux` runtime pins,
SBOM inputs, policy and rootfs schemas, plus `crates/local-apps` and
`crates/plugins/lingxi-local-app` assets. Runtime checks never require a LingXi
`clients` checkout. `scripts/mobile-linux/verify-local-app-supply-chain.py`
validates all runtime assets and the generic execution contract independently.

Rootfs and node-module tools accept `--output` / `--output-dir`; rootfs builds
also accept `--cache-dir` (or `LINGXI_NODE_SOURCE_CACHE`). Standalone defaults
are beneath this repository's `build/`. Callers using an immutable Git checkout
must provide external output/cache directories. Staging accepts an explicit
external output directory and rejects writes into source directories.

LingXi owns native launcher/iSH patches, source hashes, Swift launch wiring,
Android mksh/toybox packaging and iSH application wrappers. Its independent
`verify-local-app-host.py` checks `local-app-native-policy.json`; native source
pins live in `mobile-linux-native-pins.json`. These are separate required gates,
not optional checks conditional on the presence of client paths.

The existing release rootfs digest gap remains: synthetic tests demonstrate
verification behavior, while release verification requires committed archive
hashes and the complete pinned APK closure. Native device builds and container
rootfs builds are separate acceptance steps.

Host scripts resolve the source using
`python3 lingxi-code/scripts/runtime_source.py --root`, which follows locked
Cargo metadata. They stage into `clients/ios/build` or Android generated build
directories and do not edit the dependency checkout. The legacy
`lingxi-code/scripts/mobile-linux` runtime commands forward to that same source.
