//! `SubagentSpawner` trait impl.
//!
//! `PoolSubagentSpawner` wraps a `StateMachinePool` reference, allocates one
//! slot per spawn, and pumps the slot's `SubagentEvent` channel until a
//! terminal event arrives. The trait surface lives in `lingxi-traits` so
//! `AgentTool` in `lingxi-tools` can dispatch into the production pool
//! without taking a cyclic path-dep.
//!
//! The recursion-lock + budget-inheritance invariants flow through the
//! `SubagentInheritance` bundle (`Arc<dyn ToolInvoker>`,
//! `Arc<dyn BudgetEnforcerHandle>`) — the adapter stashes them on the child
//! `SubagentContext` so the child runner sees the same `Arc`s as the parent.
