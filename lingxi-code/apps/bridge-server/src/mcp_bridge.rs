//! MCP server definition read/write.
//!
//! MCP does **not** use the settings-layer machinery in
//! [`crate::settings_bridge`] — it has its own three storage locations
//! (`mcp/src/json_config.rs` is the parser for all of them):
//!
//! | scope     | location                                          |
//! |-----------|----------------------------------------------------|
//! | `User`    | `~/.lingxi.json`, top-level `mcpServers`            |
//! | `Local`   | `~/.lingxi.json`, under `projects[<cwd>].mcpServers`|
//! | `Project` | `<project>/.mcp.json`                               |
//!
//! (plus read-only `Dynamic` (plugins) and `Enterprise` (managed policy) —
//! [`McpScopeDto`] omits both since nothing user-initiated ever writes them.)
//!
//! The read side (`RefreshListings{Mcp}` → `ClientEvent::McpServers`) is
//! already wired through the live `McpRegistry` snapshot
//! (`router.rs`'s `ClientCommand::RefreshListings` arm calling
//! `handle.list_mcp_servers()`); this module is the WRITE side only —
//! [`upsert_server`] / [`remove_server`], routed from
//! [`client_protocol::commands::ClientCommand::UpsertMcpServer`] /
//! `RemoveMcpServer`.
//!
//! `User` and `Local` both live inside the SAME `~/.lingxi.json` file, which
//! also carries dozens of unrelated keys (`numStartups`, `oauthAccount`,
//! `projects.<key>.allowedTools`, …). Rather than reimplementing that file's
//! locked, atomic, unknown-key-preserving read-modify-write here, this module
//! reuses the SAME canonical writer the rest of the port already uses for it —
//! [`migrations::global_config::save_map`] (top-level keys) and
//! [`migrations::global_config::save_project_config`] (the
//! `projects[<key>]` sub-object) — rather than growing a second,
//! divergent implementation of that file's write contract. `Project` has no
//! such shared writer (`.mcp.json` is a plain, unlocked file, matching
//! `settings_bridge::apply_patch`'s own documented non-atomic-write
//! divergence for the settings files), so it gets a small bespoke
//! read/merge/write pair below.
//!
//! ## Internal-write marking
//!
//! `settings_bridge::apply_patch` calls `permission::mark_internal_write`
//! before writing because `apps/engine-desktop/src/settings_watch.rs` watches
//! `<lingxi_home>/settings.json` / `<project>/.lingxi/settings.json` /
//! `settings.local.json` and would otherwise mistake the desktop's own save
//! for an external edit. **Neither `~/.lingxi.json` nor `<project>/.mcp.json`
//! is watched by that (or any other) watcher in this workspace** — confirmed
//! by reading `settings_watch.rs`'s path→source mapping and grepping the repo
//! for any other `notify`/`FileSystem::watch` consumer of either path. No
//! `mark_internal_write` call would do anything here, so none is made; if a
//! watcher is ever added for these files, this comment is the reminder to
//! wire it.
