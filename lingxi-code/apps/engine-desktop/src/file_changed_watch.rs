//! File-changed watcher → `FileChanged` hook fire (parity: claude-code
//! `src/utils/hooks/fileChangedWatcher.ts`).
//!
//! claude-code resolves a set of watch paths from the user's `FileChanged` hook
//! config — each hook's `matcher` is a pipe-separated list of filenames to watch
//! in `cwd` (e.g. `".envrc|.env"`, `fileChangedWatcher.ts:48-65`) — opens a
//! chokidar watcher over them (`ignoreInitial`, `awaitWriteFinish`,
//! `:67-78`), and on every debounced `change` / `add` / `unlink` fires the
//! `FileChanged` hook with the path + the chokidar event name
//! (`handleFileEvent`, `:80-106` → `executeFileChangedHooks`,
//! `utils/hooks.ts:4278-4294`). The Rust port had no such watcher; this module
//! adds it at the desktop composition root, where the orchestrator
//! (`orch.hooks`), the `cwd`, and a `FileSystem` are all in scope.
//!
//! ## What this does (and does NOT do)
//! SCOPE is firing the hook only. This watcher resolves the watch paths from the
//! registered `FileChanged` hooks, watches the PARENT directories of those paths
//! via the in-tree `fs_watch` primitive ([`platform_api::FileSystem::watch`]), and —
//! for every changed path that is one of the resolved watch paths — fires
//! [`FileChangedFirer::fire`] best-effort with the chokidar-style event kind.
//!
//! The "dynamic watch paths" feedback loop (`fileChangedWatcher.ts:108-131`,
//! where a fired hook's `hookSpecificOutput.watchPaths` adds more paths and the
//! watcher restarts over the union) IS ported: [`FileChangedFirer::fire`]
//! returns the fired hooks' resolved `watchPaths`, the per-directory watch loop
//! forwards a non-empty set to the supervisor, and the supervisor folds them in
//! and restarts (`updateWatchPaths`, also exposed as
//! [`FileChangedWatcherHandle::update_watch_paths`]).
//!
//! The `onCwdChanged` watcher rebind (`:133-175`, function `g`) IS ported: a
//! mid-session `cd` that moves the persistent shell cwd is signalled from the
//! Bash tool through the orchestrator's `CwdChanged` firer into
//! [`FileChangedWatcherHandle::on_cwd_changed`] (via the
//! [`hooks::WatcherRebinder`] seam), which re-resolves the retained ORIGINAL
//! matchers against the new cwd, REPLACES the watch set (`r=x.watchPaths`, not a
//! union), and restarts — guarded against an unchanged cwd (`if(_===S)return`).
//! Only the pure watch-set rebind lives here: the `CwdChanged` HOOKS themselves
//! fire shell-side (the Bash tool's `CwdChanged` firer, claude-code's `hjc()` /
//! `E3r`), so this rebind NEVER re-fires them — the two halves of `g` split
//! across the shell tool and the watcher without double-firing.
//!
//! ## Directory-watch vs file-watch (chokidar parity)
//! chokidar watches the exact file paths; the in-tree primitive
//! ([`platforms/posix::watch_helper`]) watches a DIRECTORY recursively and
//! errors on a missing target. So this watcher watches the deduplicated PARENT
//! directories of the resolved file paths (so a file created after init is still
//! observed — matching chokidar's `add` event under `ignoreInitial`) and fires
//! ONLY for events whose path is in the resolved watch set — the same observable
//! result as chokidar's per-file watch.
//!
//! ## Change-kind mapping (chokidar event names)
//! The in-tree [`platform_api::FileEventKind`] maps onto the chokidar event strings
//! claude-code fires (`fileChangedWatcher.ts:75-77`):
//! - [`FileEventKind::Created`]  → `"add"`
//! - [`FileEventKind::Modified`] → `"change"`
//! - [`FileEventKind::Deleted`]  → `"unlink"`
//!
//! ## Lifecycle
//! [`FileChangedWatcher::spawn`] starts a single supervisor task (which owns one
//! per-directory watch loop for each watched directory) and returns a
//! [`FileChangedWatcherHandle`]. Dropping the handle aborts the supervisor,
//! whose owned per-directory tasks each abort via an [`AbortOnDrop`] guard (a
//! bare `JoinHandle` drop would only *detach*), so every `notify` watcher is
//! released — a clean teardown with no lingering OS handles.
