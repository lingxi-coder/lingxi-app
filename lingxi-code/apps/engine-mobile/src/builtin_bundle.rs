//! P1.4 — mobile atomic materialization with digest verification (§19.2).
//!
//! This module turns the packer's output (`local_apps::packer::pack` — an
//! archive of `[u32 LE path_len][path][u64 LE content_len][content]` records,
//! concatenated and hashed — see `local-apps/src/packer.rs`'s module docs for
//! the exact byte layout this module decodes) into a promoted, on-disk,
//! read-only builtin bundle root, verifying every byte along the way.
//!
//! ## Why "atomic" means staging + rename
//!
//! §19.2 requires that an interrupted materialization never replaces a
//! previous verified root — the on-disk state must always be either the old
//! root (untouched) or the new one (complete), never a mixture. This module
//! gets that property from the oldest trick available: write the new root's
//! files into a *staging* directory that nothing else names yet, and only
//! after every file is written and verified does
//! [`materialize_new_root`] `rename(2)` the staging directory onto its final,
//! digest-named path. A crash (or, in a test, an injected fault) at any point
//! before that rename leaves an orphaned staging directory that no caller
//! ever looks at — the previous verified root, a distinct path that was
//! never touched by this call, is exactly as it was.
//!
//! ## The two failure shapes named in the design doc
//!
//! §19.2 explicitly calls out that "an interrupted materialization does not
//! replace the previous verified root" is vacuously true when there is no
//! previous root (nothing can replace it, so any implementation "passes").
//! [`ensure_verified_builtin_root`] is written to make the two states
//! genuinely different, not merely differently named:
//!
//! - a previous verified root exists → a failed materialization returns
//!   `Ok(previous_root)`, unchanged, still fully readable;
//! - no previous verified root exists → a failed materialization returns
//!   `Err(BuiltinBundleError::BuiltinBundleUnavailable(_))` — never a panic,
//!   never a half-registered path handed back as if it were verified.
//!
//! ## Digest verification is content-sensitive, not size-sensitive
//!
//! Both the whole-archive digest ([`MaterializeError::DigestMismatch`]) and
//! the per-file digest ([`MaterializeError::PerFileDigestMismatch`]) are
//! SHA-256 over actual bytes (via `local_apps::packer::sha256_hex`, the same
//! function the packer itself pins its known-answer vectors against) — never
//! a byte-count stand-in. The tests below tamper a single byte while holding
//! every length constant specifically to prove that.
//!
//! ## P1.5 — the §6.2 idempotent short-circuit
//!
//! A second startup whose digest has not changed must not re-decode
//! `archive`. It does re-hash the promoted files because they remain writable;
//! accepting only their prior byte counts would trust same-length tampering.
//! [`ensure_verified_builtin_root`]
//! gets this from [`short_circuit_candidate`]: a previously-promoted root is
//! trusted on sight ONLY when a sibling manifest ([`RootManifest`], written by
//! [`write_manifest`] the moment a root is verified and promoted) still names
//! this exact digest and every component the caller currently expects. Seven
//! independent conditions can defeat it — a missing directory, a directory
//! that is actually a symlink, a missing manifest, an empty or entry-short
//! component list, a component whose recorded byte count or digest disagrees
//! with what the caller declares, a file whose current bytes no longer hash to
//! that digest, or a manifest whose marker field names a different digest — and
//! each is tested in isolation below specifically so
//! a check that quietly didn't exist could not hide behind a neighbor firing
//! instead. Every defeat falls all the way through to the same full
//! decode-and-verify path a first-ever materialization takes; nothing about
//! the short-circuit weakens what happens when it declines to fire.
