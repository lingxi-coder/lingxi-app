//! The mobile sibling of `engine-desktop`: the single declarative place that

//! via `Cargo.toml` — the cross-platform tools (file/task/web/plan/meta/cron/
//! ui/skill) plus the mobile-exclusive tools (camera/voice/share), the mobile
//! skill set, and the core + mobile command sets — while deliberately omitting
//! the desktop-only tools (shell/agent/mcp/lsp/team/worktree) and the
//! device-control tools. Same core agent logic, different assembly: no
//! `#[cfg(target_os)]` switching in any library crate.
//!
//! As with `engine-desktop`, the host binary owns the runtime wiring
