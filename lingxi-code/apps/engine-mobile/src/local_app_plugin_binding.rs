//! Composition binding from a Local App build target to the one plugin
//! workflow authorized to build it.
//!
//! A build target maps to a workflow NAME string, and that string is then
//! used as authority: `workflow_support::apply_materialized_local_app_collections_with_identity`
//! resolves a required workflow id for the app's pinned runtime profile and
//! REFUSES a caller-selected workflow that does not match it. That refusal is
//! security-relevant — without it a caller could point any app at any
//! workflow's collection/persistence contract — and it is pinned by the
//! characterization tests in this module plus
//! `workflow_support::tests::local_app_workflow_routes_each_published_profile_to_its_matching_workflow`
//! and its two refusal siblings.
//!
//! P-1.1 wrapped the map's output in a typed [`LocalAppWorkflowHandle`] so the
//! Host (the `apply_materialized_*` seam) stopped doing its own string
//! comparison and error formatting: it asks this binding to `resolve` a build
//! target and `enforce` the result against the caller's launched workflow id.
//! P-1.1 left the map itself (`required_workflow_id_for`) inside
//! `workflow_support.rs`, delegated to from here. P-1.3 moves the map INTO
//! this module: `workflow_support.rs` no longer contains a Local App workflow
//! name of any kind, so this binding is now the one place a build target maps
//! to its required workflow id, both in the sense that the Host never
//! compares the strings itself (Phase -1's original point) and in the sense
//! that no name lives outside this file (§18 Phase -1 step 4 / §19.3's gate).
