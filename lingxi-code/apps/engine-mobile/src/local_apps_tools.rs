//! First-party local-app host operations, registered as ORDINARY BUILTIN tools.
//!
//! These were previously reachable only as `mcp__local_apps__<op>`. That name
//! shape carried third-party-MCP permission semantics they were never meant to
//! have:
//!
//! - `permission::tool_default` is a flat table keyed by literal tool name with
//!   `.unwrap_or(DenyByDefault)`. No `mcp__…` name is in it, so EVERY call —
//!   `build`, `read_logs`, `manage_runtime` — raised a permission prompt. In
//!   the create flow that is a prompt per step.
//! - MCP rule matching is tool-wide: content matching is gated on Deny/Ask, so
//!   no allow rule could ever scope one of these to a single app. A grant
//!   written into one app's workspace settings meant "any app on this device,
//!   forever".
//!
//! They are first-party host operations that take `app_id` as a parameter —
//! the shape of a builtin tool, not of a user-configured MCP server. As
//! builtins they get ordinary permission semantics: a real entry in the
//! defaults table, and content matching, so `LocalAppBuild(<app_id>)` becomes
//! expressible.
//!
//! ## What deliberately stays on the MCP transport
//!
//! The DYNAMIC per-app tools (`mcp__local_apps__<app_id>__data_query`, …) are
//! NOT moved, for two independent reasons:
//!
//! 1. Their namespace is load-bearing: the provider binds `app_id` host-side
//!    and REJECTS a model-supplied one ("app_id is host-bound by the app MCP
//!    namespace"). That is the correct scoping mechanism and it already works.
//! 2. They must be registered at RUNTIME, when an app is created mid-session.
//!    `ToolRegistry::register_builtin` takes `&mut self` (construction only);
//!    only `register_mcp_tools(&self, …)` can add tools to a shared registry.
