//! P-1.0 — component-literal scanner.
//!
//! Fails when a Local App component NAME (skill / agent / workflow) appears
//! as a literal in PRODUCTION source outside an explicit, counted allowlist
//! (`tests/component_literal_allowlist.txt`).
//!
//! ## Needle derivation — the one thing that makes this non-trivial
//!
//! The needle set is derived from the LIVE registries at test time, never
//! from a name list hand-typed into this file:
//!
//! - skill basenames come from the build-time verified Plugin inventory exposed
//!   by [`engine_mobile::mobile_plugin_skill_names`];
//! - Local App workflow basenames come from [`local_app_workflow_basenames`],
//!   which lists the three plugin-owned workflow IDENTITIES
//!   (`lingxi-local-app:local-app-build`, `:local-app-use-test`,
//!   `:local-app-mcp-authoring`) and strips the namespace off each.
//!
//!   ⚠️ Read that literally: for WORKFLOWS this file does keep a list, and the
//!   "no hardcoded name array" rule below is satisfied only in the narrow sense
//!   that no OTHER copy is being twinned. Phase 9 moved the Local App workflows
//!   out of the binary — `tools/workflow/src/builtins.rs` now ships
//!   `deep-research` alone, and its `BuiltinWorkflowDescriptor` has exactly four
//!   fields (`name`, `description`, `script`, `manual_only`) — so no live
//!   in-process registry can answer "which workflows build a Local App" any
//!   more. `scanner_workflow_needles_survive_the_name_list_deletion` pins the
//!   list to exactly those three basenames and proves the derived needles still
//!   catch a planted name, which is the only guard this shape can carry.
//!
//!   An earlier revision of this paragraph claimed the source was
//!   `tool_workflow::BUILTIN_WORKFLOWS.local_app_build_workflow_names()` reading
//!   a typed `is_local_app_build` field. NEITHER symbol exists anywhere in this
//!   tree, and neither ever did — `git grep -P` finds them only in prose like
//!   this. Grep before restating any version of that claim.
//!
//! Design doc `docs/local-apps/LOCAL-APP-PLUGIN-DESIGN-V2.md` §8.5/§19.3:
//! "Phase -1 尚无 Plugin inventory，scanner 暂时读取现有 live builtin
//! skill/workflow registries；两阶段都禁止在 scanner 内维护第二份名称数组。"
//! Phase 2 swaps this needle-derivation seam for the verified Plugin
//! inventory; this file must not grow a hardcoded name array in the
//! meantime — see `scanner_needle_comes_from_discovery_not_from_a_static_array`
//! below, which drives the WHOLE production pipeline
//! ([`needle_set_from`] + [`scan_source_tree`]) off a grown registry and off
//! the real [`production_needle_set`], so narrowing either one is caught.
//!
//! Each basename is doubled into its namespaced FQN (`lingxi-local-app:
//! <basename>`) because a scanner that only matched bare basenames would miss
//! (or under-report) a host module that spells out the Plugin-qualified form —
//! §8.5: "needle 必须同时覆盖 basename 与 namespaced FQN".
//!
//! ## The two views every file is scanned through
//!
//! §8.5's full sentence is "否则 host 模块拼 FQN 或**拆串**即可绕过按
//! basename 的匹配" — the FQN half AND the split-string half. A per-line
//! substring match answers only the first: `concat!("local-app", "-build")`,
//! a rustfmt-wrapped long string literal, or any other assembly of the name
//! out of adjacent fragments walks straight past it. So every file is scanned
//! twice:
//!
//! 1. the RAW view, line by line;
//! 2. a NORMALIZED view of the whole file with `"`, `\`, `,`, `)`, `+`, all
//!    whitespace and the no-op assembly tokens in [`STRIPPED_TOKENS`]
//!    (`concat!(`, `.to_string(`, `String::from(`, …) removed, matched across
//!    line boundaries and reported at the line where the match STARTS.
//!
//! View 2 is a strict superset of view 1 for these needles (none of them
//! contains a stripped character), so occurrences are de-duplicated by their
//! byte span and an occurrence seen only in view 2 is reported as a SPLIT
//! literal. `concat!("local-app", "-build")`, a rustfmt-wrapped long literal
//! and `"local-app".to_string() + "-build"` are all caught this way.
//!
//! TWO shapes remain out of reach, named here rather than left to look covered
//! (`normalization_has_exactly_these_two_documented_limits` pins both, so
//! strengthening the normalizer forces this paragraph to be rewritten):
//!
//! - PLACEHOLDER SUBSTITUTION — `format!("local-{}-build", "app")`, or the JS
//!   template literal `` `local-${x}-build` ``. Catching these needs argument
//!   substitution, which is evaluation, not normalization.
//! - FRAGMENTS SEPARATED BY CODE THAT IS NOT A NO-OP — a statement-level
//!   assembly (`let mut s = String::from("local-app"); s.push_str("-build");`)
//!   leaves `;s.push_str(` between the halves, and single-quoted JS fragments
//!   (`'local-app' + '-build'`) keep their quotes because `'` is a Rust
//!   lifetime sigil and cannot be stripped globally.
//!
//! ## Scan surface
//!
//! Deny-by-default directory enumeration over THREE roots, not one:
//! `apps/engine-mobile/src`, `tasks/src` and `tools/workflow/src`. §19.3's
//! last bullet ("`tasks/src` 与 `tools/workflow/src` 不含 Local App workflow
//! basename/list") and P-1.9's completion condition are stated over the latter
//! two, so a scanner rooted only at `engine-mobile/src` could never gate them.
//! A missing root is a hard panic: a root that silently resolves to nothing
//! is the exact no-op that makes a gate green for the wrong reason.
//!
//! Deny-by-default applies to file TYPES too: the extension filter is a
//! DENY-list ([`SKIPPED_EXTENSIONS`]) of formats that cannot be UTF-8 source,
//! not an allow-list of the ones we happened to think of. An UNKNOWN extension
//! is scanned. It used to be `["rs", "js"]`, which left
//! `workflow/src/workflow_description.txt` and
//! `workflow_input_schema.json` — both `include_str!`ed into production, the
//! first being the Workflow tool's own model-facing description — unscanned
//! INSIDE a declared root.
//!
//! `#[cfg(test)]` regions are skipped ("测试 fixtures" are the one place
//! component names may live unlisted — §8.5), including OUT-OF-LINE test
//! modules (`#[cfg(test)] #[path = "registry_test.rs"] mod registry_test;`),
//! whose whole file is excluded — but only when EVERY `mod` declaration that
//! reaches that file is itself `#[cfg(test)]`, so a second, test-gated `mod`
//! aimed at a production file cannot smuggle it out of the scan.
//!
//! Both of those are RUST-ONLY and are not run over other file types. There is
//! no `#[cfg(test)]` in JS or JSON, and [`code_view`] lexes Rust comments and
//! Rust string literals — not JS template or regex literals — so running the
//! detector there could only ever HIDE production text: a template literal
//! containing a line that trims to exactly `#[cfg(test)]` followed by a line
//! ending in `{` would open a skip range in a file that has no such construct.
//!
//! ## Allowlist keying and counting — the load-bearing part
//!
//! Phase -1 deliberately KEEPS the two pre-existing Local App workflow
//! registrations (`tools/workflow/src/builtins.rs` plus the three `.js`
//! files it `include_str!`s). So this scanner CANNOT be green at zero
//! occurrences today, by design.
//!
//! This paragraph used to give a SECOND reason — the skill-name mirror in
//! `register_mobile_skill_commands`, which carried its own hardcoded copy of
//! the ten bundled mobile skill names. P-1.5 deleted that copy: the mirror now
//! iterates `mobile_skill_registry()` itself and names no skill, so it
//! contributes no allowlisted literal and is no longer part of why this
//! scanner's baseline is non-zero.
//!
//! The allowlist is therefore:
//!
//! - EXPLICIT: one entry per `path:literal` pair, matched by EXACT equality on
//!   both — no globs, no directory entries, no prefix matching;
//! - COUNTED TWICE: each entry carries the `expected_count` of occurrences of
//!   that literal in that file (so one entry can never cover an unbounded
//!   number of occurrences), and
//!   `allowlist_entry_count_matches_the_committed_baseline` pins the number of
//!   entries to [`ALLOWLIST_BASELINE_COUNT`];
//! - EXACT, NOT PERMISSIVE: an entry whose count no longer matches — in EITHER
//!   direction — fails, and an entry that matches nothing at all fails
//!   (`every_allowlist_entry_still_matches_a_real_occurrence`). A permitted
//!   SUPERSET would mean deleting the scanned code, or dropping a file from
//!   the walk, leaves the gate green with a stale pre-approved hole sitting at
//!   a fixed location forever.
//!
//! Entries are deliberately NOT keyed on line numbers. A line-keyed allowlist
//! turns every unrelated edit above an allowlisted line into a spurious leak
//! whose cheapest fix is re-typing line numbers with the count unchanged —
//! which is the re-baseline reflex this gate exists to prevent. The FAILURE
//! OUTPUT is still line-numbered: "name the file and the line" is a
//! requirement on what the gate SAYS, not on what the allowlist is keyed by.

// (`skill-api/src/builtin/mod.rs`'s `parse_builtin` ASSIGNS that field after
// parsing, so a bundled SKILL.md's own frontmatter cannot be a second source
// for it — `bundled.rs` is the only construction path for a bundled skill's

// (`skill-api/src`, not `apps/engine-mobile/src` / `tasks/src` /
// `tools/workflow/src`), so the literal-scan gate above has no reach into it
// at all — the trigger array is a blind spot the file-literal scan was never
// going to cover, which is why this defect needed its own narrower check
// rather than an allowlist entry, and why the allowlist baseline is untouched

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// P1.7 (§19.3) — `register_verified_builtin` has exactly one call site.
//
// `plugin::PluginManager::register_verified_builtin` (`plugin/src/
// manager.rs`) is the one door into the plugin registry that bypasses
// `install`'s validation path — P0a.6 added it deliberately for the single
// compiled-in mobile plugin, whose `(id, manifest, install_dir)` triple never
// passed through untrusted input. Its whole safety argument rests on there
// being exactly one, auditable caller, in the composition module
// (`apps/engine-mobile/src/lib.rs`'s `register_mobile_builtin_plugin`). A
// second call site anywhere is an unaudited second door, and nothing before
// this gate would have noticed one.
//
// This is a COUNTING gate of the same shape as the literal scanner above —
// deny-by-default directory enumeration, `#[cfg(test)]` regions and
// out-of-line test modules excluded, `code_view`'s comment/string blanking
// reused so a match inside a doc comment or a string literal can never reach
// the matcher — but it counts CALL SITES of one specific symbol, not
// occurrences of a set of string literals, so it needs one more thing the
// literal scanner does not: telling a CALL apart from a MENTION.
//
// `register_verified_builtin` appears five times as plain PROSE on this
// gate's scan surface for `lib.rs` — four in genuinely production code (one
// `//` line comment, three `///` doc comments) plus one in a comment inside
// `#[cfg(all(test, feature = "uniffi"))] mod mobile_plugin_composition_tests`,
// which `test_skip_ranges` does not treat as a test region because it matches
// only the exact attribute `#[cfg(test)]`.
// `verify_mention_shapes_in_lib_rs_are_what_this_gate_assumes` below pins
// every one of those shapes and counts, so this paragraph cannot rot into
// fiction and so the mention-rejection rule cannot quietly stop being
// exercised on the real tree. A rule that counted every appearance of the
// word would therefore report SIX where there is truly one call — worse than
// reporting zero, because it would never be able to go green again without
// deleting the documentation that explains why the one real call site is
// safe. The distinguishing rule
// this file uses: scan the SAME blanked view [`code_view`] already lexes
// (comments and string/char literal content replaced with spaces, so a doc
// comment or an error-message string never reaches the matcher at all), then
// require a whole-word occurrence of the symbol to be followed — after only
// whitespace, possibly across a line break — by `(`. A doc mention is never
// followed by `(` in the source text itself (its "call-like" reading only
// exists in the reader's head), so it is excluded twice over: once by the
// comment blanking, and again by the trailing-`(` requirement even for the
// (impossible in Rust) case of a bare mention sitting in live code.
//
// The scan root is deliberately narrower than [`SCAN_ROOTS`]: the
// requirement is stated over `engine-mobile` specifically ("`register_
// verified_builtin` is called exactly once in `engine-mobile`, from the
// composition module") — not over `tasks/src` or `tools/workflow/src`,
// neither of which depends on the `plugin` crate at all. Scanning only
// `apps/engine-mobile/src` also means the function's own DEFINITION
// (`plugin/src/manager.rs`, `pub async fn register_verified_builtin(`) can
// never enter this scan, so `0`-vs-`1` here can never be explained by having
// walked into the definition instead of a caller. The `fn`-keyword guard in
// [`find_call_sites`] is kept anyway, as defense in depth against a
// same-named wrapper `fn` ever being added inside this root — untested by a
// dedicated fixture (nothing in this root has ever needed it), but cheap
// enough to keep rather than assume the shape of tomorrow's code from here.

///    away before the matcher runs. A condition that is vacuously true in
///    every state the suite reaches is not a tested condition; it is
///    decoration that reads like a safeguard.
/// 2. It would be WRONG for this symbol. `register_verified_builtin` is an
///    inherent `async fn` on `PluginManager`, so in live code its name can
///    only be its definition or a USE of it — and a use spelled without
///    parentheses is still a door: `let door =
///    plugin::PluginManager::register_verified_builtin;` yields a callable
///    function item, and `door(&manager, id, manifest, dir).await` opens the
///    registry just as wide as the method-call spelling. A paren rule would
///    have made that second-door spelling invisible to the very gate whose
///    job is to find second doors. Inherent methods also cannot be `use`d,
///    so there is no import spelling that would need excusing.
///
/// The call-versus-mention distinction the requirement asks for therefore
/// rests entirely on the comment/string blanking plus the whole-word check,
