//! The transport-agnostic event sink.
//!
//! [`ClientEventSink`] is the ONE seam the engine→DTO bridge writes to. Every
//! adapter component that produces a [`ClientEvent`] — the live-turn
//! [`crate::output_stream::AdapterOutputStream`] (F1-12), the permission gate
//! (F1-14), the turn wrapper (F1-13) — pushes through this trait, never to a
//! concrete transport.
//!
//! Both transports supply their own sink implementation:
//! - bridge-server (Electron) wraps an outbound WebSocket `Frame::Event` writer
//!   (F2),
//! - mobile (iOS/Android) wraps the UniFFI `ClientEventListener` callback (F3).
//!
//! Keeping the adapter coupled only to this trait — and never to a transport —
//! is what lets the SAME lowering logic feed both surfaces (governing decision
//! §0.1 / §0.2).

/// can be shared across the output stream, the permission gate, and the turn
/// wrapper.
