//! Transport-neutral derivation of how one tool call is presented.
//!
//! Everything here is plain data computed from `(tool_name, input_json,
//! result_json)`. It has no terminal dependency and no styling: the terminal
//! renders it through `crate::render`, and `client-adapter` lowers it onto the
//! wire for the iOS, Android, and Electron clients. Deriving it once is the
//! point — before this module each surface built its own header text and
//! result summary, and four implementations had already drifted apart.
//!
//! This component is shared by terminal and native clients and must not
//! depend on terminal I/O or a particular client protocol.
//!
//! Three pieces:
//!
//! - [`header`] — the parameterized call header (`Update(src/host.rs)`).
//! - [`result`] — the `⎿` result headline and the expandable body.
//! - [`plan`] — the model-managed todo checklist pinned above the composer.
