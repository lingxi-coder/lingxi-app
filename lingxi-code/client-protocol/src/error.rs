//! `ClientError` — the flat, `#[derive(uniffi::Error)]`-ready result error.
//!
//! `ClientError` is the typed error returned across a `Result` boundary by a
//! client transport — most directly the mobile `submit(command) -> Result<(),
//! ClientError>` FFI entry point (plan F3-05). It is DISTINCT from
//! [`crate::events::ErrorKindDto`]: that enum is the coarse class carried by the
//! streaming, fire-and-forget [`crate::events::ClientEvent::Error`]; this enum
//! is the *call-result* error a synchronous request resolves to.
//!
//! ## Flat by design (decision §0.4, plan F1-07)
//!
//! Every variant is FLAT — each carries a single `message: String` field with NO
//! nested non-FFI payloads. `serde_json::Value` and other non-UniFFI-representable
//! types are deliberately excluded so the `#[derive(uniffi::Error)]` (added in
//! F3-01, once `uniffi` is vendored/pinned offline in F3-00) lands without a
//! shape change. F1-07 freezes the shape and the `thiserror` `Display` strings;
//! F3-01 turns the FFI-flatness into a real compile-time check by enabling the
//! derive under the `uniffi` feature.
//!
//! A *struct* variant (`{ message }`) rather than a tuple variant is used so the
//! type honors the frozen §0.1 serde convention `#[serde(tag = "type")]`: serde
//! cannot internally-tag a newtype variant wrapping a primitive `String`, but it
//! can tag a struct variant. The shape stays flat (one `String` field) and
//! UniFFI-flat-error compatible.
//!
//! The derive is feature-gated with `#[cfg_attr(feature = "uniffi", …)]` so the
//! SAME type compiles plain (bridge-server) and as a `UniFFI` error (mobile). The
//! `cfg_attr` line is wired in F3-01; at F1-07 the `uniffi` package is not yet a
//! dependency (it is commented out in `Cargo.toml` until F3-00), so adding the
//! derive now would break the stubbed `--features uniffi` build. The type is
//! kept derive-*ready* instead.
