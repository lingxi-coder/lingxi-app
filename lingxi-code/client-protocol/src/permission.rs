//! Permission DTOs — the request/response shape sourced from
//! `traits::PermissionGate::check` (plan F1-04).
//!
//! The orchestrator binds `Arc<dyn PermissionGate>` and calls
//! `check(name, &Value) -> PermissionDecision` (governing decision §0.6,
//! verified `tui/src/permission_bridge.rs:64-117`). The `client-adapter`'s
//! `AdapterPermissionGate` (F1-14) translates that call into a
//! [`PermissionRequest`] emitted to the client and parks the turn future on a
//! oneshot until a [`PermissionResolved`] (carrying a [`PermissionResponseDto`])
//! arrives on the inbound command path.
//!
//! Live vs. reserved (decision §0.6):
//! - [`PermissionKindDto::ToolUseConfirm`] is the ONLY kind with a live engine
//!   source — `check()` can source only it.
//! - [`PermissionKindDto::ExitPlanMode`] and
//!   [`PermissionKindDto::BypassPermissionsMode`] are RESERVED / feed-deferred:
//!   defined here so the contract freezes now, but they MUST NOT be wired to a
//!   live source in the foundation. They mirror the engine-side
//!   `traits::PermissionRequest` (`prompting_gate.rs:32`) three-variant shape.
//!
//! Frozen serde conventions (decision §0.1):
//! - internally tagged: `#[serde(tag = "type", rename_all = "snake_case")]`,
//! - reserved-extensible enums are `#[non_exhaustive]`,
//! - every optional field uses
//!   `#[serde(default, skip_serializing_if = "Option::is_none")]`.
//!
//! Tool payloads are JSON **Strings** (`tool_input_json`); `serde_json::Value`
//! never enters the contract crate (decision §0.4). The engine-side
//! `PromptDefault` (`traits/src/prompting_gate.rs:18`) is collapsed to
//! `default_allow: bool` (`AllowByDefault` ⇒ `true`).
