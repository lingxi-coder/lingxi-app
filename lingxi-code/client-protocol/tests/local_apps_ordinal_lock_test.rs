//! r1-backlog-protocol-mirrors-05 — the positional lock `variant_ordinal_lock_test.rs`
//! does not cover.
//!
//! # What this catches that `variant_ordinal_lock_test.rs` cannot
//!
//! That file freezes `ClientCommand` and `ClientEvent` declaration order. It
//! says nothing about `local_apps.rs`, whose own doc comments make the same
//! claim about their own types:
//!
//! - `AppRecordDto` (a `#[derive(uniffi::Record)]` struct) — `scaffolded`'s
//!   doc comment: "Appended LAST: UniFFI encodes record fields POSITIONALLY,
//!   so a field inserted above `workspace_rel` would be reinterpreted by a
//!   client built against the previous bindings."
//! - `AppEventDto` (a `#[derive(uniffi::Enum)]` enum) — `AppCreated`'s doc
//!   comment: "Appended at the END, and that is load-bearing rather than
//!   tidy: UniFFI encodes this enum POSITIONALLY, so a variant inserted
//!   anywhere above renumbers every variant after it."
//! - `PluginCommandDto` (also `#[derive(uniffi::Enum)]`) — its own doc:
//!   "Future §17.1 additions … extend this enum, not `ClientCommand` again",
//!   i.e. it is a real UniFFI enum subject to the same ordinal rule, just
//!   never given a lock.
//!
//! - `LocalAppVerificationStatusDto` (`#[derive(uniffi::Enum)]`,
//!   `#[non_exhaustive]`) — five variants both mobile clients switch on.
//! - `LocalAppCreateConfirmationRequestDto` and
//!   `LocalAppMcpProposalApprovalRequestDto` (both `#[derive(uniffi::Record)]`)
//!   — the two native approval sheets' payloads.
//!
//! The last three were added here rather than to a fourth parser inside
//! `src/local_apps.rs`'s own `mod tests`: `cargo test -p client-protocol
//! --test local_apps_ordinal_lock_test` is the command a lane runs after
//! touching these types, and a lock it does not execute is not a lock.
//!
//! Before this file, nothing would fail if a field were spliced above
//! `workspace_rel`, or a variant spliced into the middle of `AppEventDto` or
//! `PluginCommandDto`: `version_guard_test.rs` fingerprints an UNORDERED
//! map of `"<type>::<member>" -> "<wire type>"`, so it is as blind to
//! position as the commands/events guard `variant_ordinal_lock_test.rs`
//! describes itself fixing for those two enums.
//!
//! # The rule this enforces
//!
//! The members frozen below are `AppRecordDto`'s fields, and
//! `PluginCommandDto` / `AppEventDto`'s variants, as declared at the
//! `CLIENT_PROTOCOL_VERSION` 12.0.0 bless (commit `0c313e1b9`,
//! `client-protocol/src/local_apps.rs`). Each must still sit at exactly the
//! index recorded here.
//!
//! - Appending AFTER the frozen prefix: allowed, no bump. Do not add it here
//!   — this is the 12.0.0 snapshot, not a mirror of the current type.
//! - Inserting, removing or reordering anything inside the frozen prefix:
//!   this test goes red and names the ordinal. Move it to the end instead.
//!   If it genuinely cannot go last, that is a MAJOR `CLIENT_PROTOCOL_VERSION`
//!   bump plus a re-bless of `snapshots/blessed_major.txt`, and the frozen
//!   lists here are then re-cut from the new major.
