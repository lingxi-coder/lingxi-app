//! The gate that keeps `client-protocol` buildable for iOS and Android.
//!
//! # The failure mode this exists to catch
//!
//! `#[derive(uniffi::Enum)]` / `#[derive(uniffi::Record)]` fold a type's whole
//! description — module path, every variant name, every field name, every field
//! type tag, and every `///` docstring on the type, its variants and their
//! fields — into ONE compile-time `uniffi_core::MetadataBuffer`. That buffer is
//! a fixed `[u8; BUF_SIZE]` with `BUF_SIZE` hardcoded to 16384 in
//! `uniffi_core`, and the writers `assert!` on overflow **in a `const`
//! context**.
//!
//! So overflow is not a warning and not a truncation. It is
//! `error[E0080]: evaluation of constant value failed`, `client-protocol
//! --features uniffi` stops compiling, and every mobile client — `ios-framework`,
//! `android-aar`, `engine-mobile` — becomes unbuildable. On 2026-08-27
//! `ClientCommand` crossed that line at 20156 bytes and the iOS and Android
//! apps could not be built at all.
//!
//! # Why nothing caught it
//!
//! Every gate on the desktop side (`cargo test -p bridge-server`, the electron
//! suites, `cargo check` at the workspace root) builds `client-protocol` with
//! DEFAULT features, where `uniffi` is off and none of this metadata exists.
//! The feature that breaks is the one nothing enabled. Hence a test that
//! *only* exists under `--features uniffi`, plus the `mobile-ffi-surface` CI
//! job that actually turns the feature on.
//!
//! # Why a budget rather than just "does it compile"
//!
//! By the time the hard limit is hit, the crate no longer compiles, so no test
//! can report anything — the only signal is a const-eval panic pointing at a
//! `derive` in someone else's crate. This test fires 4096 bytes EARLIER, while
//! the code still builds, and says which type is running out of room and what
//! to do about it.
