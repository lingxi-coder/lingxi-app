//! Shared builtin command scaffolding used by the impl crate `command-core`
//! (and any platform command handlers registered directly in the composition
//! roots):
//!
//! - [`names`] — the locked 108-name table (`BUILTIN_COMMAND_NAMES`),
//!   the 18-name core list (`BUILTIN_CORE_NAMES`), `core_description`, the
//!   bucket-(d) `INTENTIONALLY_DISABLED_COMMANDS` audit table, and its STUB.6
//!   refinement into `CORRECT_BY_DESIGN_STUBS` (faithful) vs
//!   `HOST_BOUND_DEFERRED_GAPS` (genuine deferred gaps).
//! - [`help_render`] — the byte-locked `/help` screen renderer.
//! - [`list_render`] — the generic `/agents` `/hooks` `/mcp` list renderer.
//! - [`unimplemented`] — the per-name stub handler returning the locked
//!   "not implemented" literal.
