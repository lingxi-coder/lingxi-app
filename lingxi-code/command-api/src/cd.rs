//! `/cd` — byte-exact model-visible strings for the "move this session to a
//! new working directory" command (claude-code 2.1.207 `local-jsx` `name:"cd"`).
//!
//! The command itself is interactive (a confirm prompt, then a
//! [`crate::builtin_support`]-registered `SessionCwd` swap driven by the TUI +
//! the CLI `run_permission_action` effect channel). This module is the single
//! source of the two byte-faithful strings both surfaces render — the confirm
//! prompt and the post-move result message — so the TUI confirm view
//! (`tui::bottom_pane::cd_confirm_view`) and the CLI swap effect
//! (`apps/cli/src/mode.rs`) can never drift.
//!
//! Oracle (2.1.207, canonical binary):
//! - confirm prompt @ byte 198796864 (`? This moves the session's working …`).
//! - result template @ the `tengu_cd_command` module: `The session's working
//!   directory has changed to ${s} (${t==="cd_command"?"via /cd":"by the
//!   user"}). The environment block at the start of this conversation still
//!   names the ` + `previous directory — that information is stale. All
//!   tool calls and ` + `relative paths now resolve from ${s}.` — for the `/cd`
//!   slash path `t === "cd_command"`, so the parenthetical is `via /cd`.
