//! The `/checkup` bundled skill — port of Claude Code 2.1.267's `No()`
//! registrar (`src_172124278.js`), whose body is `is()`.
//!
//! ```js
//! uo({ name:"doctor", aliases:["checkup"],
//!      isEnabled:()=>!a.DISABLE_DOCTOR_COMMAND,
//!      survivesBundledKillSwitch:!0, requires:{workspace:!0},
//!      terminalOriented:!0, userInvocable:!0, disableModelInvocation:!0,
//!      progressMessage:"running checkup",
//!      async getPromptForCommand(e){ let o=is();
//!        if(e) o+=`\n\n## Additional instructions from the user\n\n${e}`;
//!        return [{type:"text",text:o}] } })
//! ```
//!
//! ## Why this is `/checkup` and not `/doctor`
//!
//! Upstream registers it as `doctor` with `checkup` as an alias. This port
//! already ships a `/doctor` that is a DIFFERENT thing: a deterministic command
//! producing a structured `DoctorReport` DTO that the GUI clients render as a
//! screen (`client-adapter`'s `doctor_report_parity`). Upstream's is a
//! `terminalOriented` model-driven narrative. Both want the name; they serve
//! different surfaces and neither subsumes the other.
//!
//! Registering under upstream's own alias keeps both, breaks no client, and
//! avoids inventing a name: `checkup` is what upstream calls it too. Decision
//! taken by the user, 2026-09-10.
//!
//! ## What was cut, and why
//!
//! Two of upstream's ten checks are Anthropic-DISTRIBUTION diagnostics with no
//! counterpart here, and this port's accepted divergences already exclude the
//! Anthropic backend/distribution surface:
//!
//! * **Check 7 (version currency)** — removed whole. Every mechanism in it is
//!   Anthropic's: `npm view @anthropic-ai/claude-code`, the
//!   `downloads.claude.ai/claude-code-releases` endpoint, the `claude-code`
//!   Homebrew casks, and `claude update`. LingXi ships through none of them.
//! * **Check 0's first two bullets** (duplicate/leftover installs, native
//!   launcher missing from PATH) — same reason: they enumerate `~/.local/bin/claude`,
//!   npm-global `@anthropic-ai/claude-code`, and `installMethod`.
//!
//! Check 0's remaining three bullets — unparseable settings files, broken or
//! colliding agent definitions, malformed skill frontmatter — map exactly and
//! are kept. Checks 1-6 and 8-9 are unchanged apart from rebranding.
//!
//! Removing check 7 means the cross-references had to move with it: the check
//! list in the report format, the "checks 0 and 7" command note, the
//! consolidated-cleanup gate, and the data-sources header (which advertised
//! check 7 as the one permitted network call — this checkup now makes NO
//! network requests). [`tests::the_check_numbering_is_self_consistent`] pins
//! that, because a stale cross-reference is invisible to every other gate.
//!
//! ## Substrate that differs
//!
//! Every path the body names was verified against this port rather than
//! rebranded on faith:
//!
//! | upstream | here |
//! |---|---|
//! | `~/.claude.json` `skillUsage` | `~/.lingxi/skill_usage.json` (`command_api::skill_usage`) |
//! | `~/.claude/projects/<cwd>/*.jsonl` | `~/.lingxi/projects/<cwd>[-<djb2>]/*.jsonl` (`session::jsonl::path`) |
//! | `.claude/{settings,agents,rules,skills}` | `.lingxi/…` (`branding::DOT_DIR`) |
//! | `getMaxMemoryCharacterCount` | `memory::MAX_MEMORY_CHARACTER_COUNT` |
//! | `claude plugin validate` / `claude mcp remove` | `lingxi-cli …` |
//!
//! ⚠️ `pluginUsage` has NO counterpart — this port tracks skill usage but not
//! plugin usage — so the body's plugin-usage guidance rests on transcript
//! evidence alone, which is the fallback upstream already specifies for
//! zero-count plugins.
//!
//! ⛔ `mcp__claude_ai_<connector>__` is left verbatim. It is the literal wire
//! prefix for claude.ai connectors, not branding; rebranding it would stop the
//! model matching real transcript entries.
