//! Bundled `/loop` skill — 1:1 port of the 2.1.191 binary's `/loop`
//! `getPromptForCommand` builder.
//!
//! The binary registers `/loop` via `_Zm()` (cc_all.txt:521920) with a
//! `getPromptForCommand(e,t)`. Through 2.1.2xx that dispatch was gated on two
//! feature flags (`tengu_kairos_loop_dynamic`, `tengu_kairos_loop_prompt`); in
//! **2.1.263 neither flag exists in the binary** and the gated branches are the
//! only reachable ones.
//!
//! The dispatch matrix (see [`LoopPromptFn::build`]):
//!   1. no-prompt (empty / interval-only) → the autonomous-default builder
//!      `a(loopFile, dynamic)` (binary inline `a=(c,u)`); `dynamic` only when the
//!      input is fully empty
//!   2. otherwise → `gZm(n)`, the combined fixed-interval + dynamic prompt
//!   3. the pre-2.1.263 cron-only variants (`dZm` usage / `fZm(n)`) are retained
//!      for provenance but are no longer reachable
//!
//! The two `tengu_kairos_loop_*` flags are read through the sync flag reader
//! [`telemetry::flag_bool`] (the port's `nt`); with no live GrowthBook fetcher
//! wired they sit at the binary's shipped `false`, so only branch 3 is reachable
//! — byte-identical to the shipped binary. (Unlike PERSISTENT/KEEPALIVE, the
//! PROMPT/DYNAMIC gates are FLAG-ONLY — the binary `fJr`/`q_e` have no env layer,
//! so there is no `LINGXI_LOOP_PROMPT`/`_DYNAMIC` env; tests flip the flags
//! via `telemetry::test_set_flag`.) The flag-on builders live in
//! [`cron`]'s `autonomous_loop` module (loop.md detection, the preamble, the
//! sentinels, `logAutonomousLoopActivation`), imported here exactly as the binary
//! loop command imports `QVe = io(T3e)`. The cloud-offer / push-notification
//! splices (`zpc`/`Ypc`/`Kpc`) are gated on `tengu_surreal_dali` /
//! `allow_remote_sessions` / push-notif (all default off, no port subsystem) and
//! render "" — matching the default-disabled binary path.
//!
//! Literal interpolations resolve to constants here: `${VSt}` = `10m`,
//! `${xw}` = `CronCreate`, `${t9}` = `CronDelete`,
//! `${Kh}` = `ScheduleWakeup`, `${IA}` = `Monitor`,
//! `${AI}` = `TaskList`, `${eP}` = `TaskStop`.

        "# /loop — schedule a recurring prompt
Parse the input below into `[interval] <prompt…>` and schedule it with CronCreate.
## Parsing (in priority order)
1. **Leading token**: if the first whitespace-delimited token matches `^\\d+[smhd]$` (e.g. `5m`, `2h`), that's the interval; the rest is the prompt.
2. **Trailing \"every\" clause**: otherwise, if the input ends with `every <N><unit>` or `every <N> <unit-word>` (e.g. `every 20m`, `every 5 minutes`, `every 2 hours`), extract that as the interval and strip it from the prompt. Only match when what follows \"every\" is a time expression — `check every PR` has no interval.
3. **Default**: otherwise, interval is `{default}` and the entire input is the prompt.
If the resulting prompt is empty, show usage `/loop [interval] <prompt>` and stop — do not call CronCreate.
Examples:
- `5m /babysit-prs` → interval `5m`, prompt `/babysit-prs` (rule 1)
- `check the deploy every 20m` → interval `20m`, prompt `check the deploy` (rule 2)
- `run tests every 5 minutes` → interval `5m`, prompt `run tests` (rule 2)
- `check the deploy` → interval `{default}`, prompt `check the deploy` (rule 3)
- `check every PR` → interval `{default}`, prompt `check every PR` (rule 3 — \"every\" not followed by time)
- `5m` → empty prompt → show usage

## Interval → cron
Supported suffixes: `s` (seconds, rounded up to nearest minute, min 1), `m` (minutes), `h` (hours), `d` (days). Convert:
| Interval pattern      | Cron expression     | Notes                                    |
|-----------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `Nm` where N ≤ 59   | `*/N * * * *`     | every N minutes                          |
| `Nm` where N ≥ 60   | `0 */H * * *`     | round to hours (H = N/60, must divide 24)|
| `Nh` where N ≤ 23   | `0 */N * * *`     | every N hours                            |
| `Nd`                | `0 0 */N * *`     | every N days at midnight local           |
| `Ns`                | treat as `ceil(N/60)m` | cron minimum granularity is 1 minute  |
**If the interval doesn't cleanly divide its unit** (e.g. `7m` → `*/7 * * * *` gives uneven gaps at :56→:00; `90m` → 1.5h which cron can't express), pick the nearest clean interval and tell the user what you rounded to before scheduling.
## Action
1. Call CronCreate with:
   - `cron`: the expression from the table above
   - `prompt`: the parsed prompt from above, verbatim (slash commands are passed through unchanged)
   - `recurring`: `true`
2. Briefly confirm: what's scheduled, the cron expression, the human-readable cadence, that recurring tasks run until cancelled, and that they can cancel with CronDelete (include the job ID).
3. **Then immediately execute the parsed prompt now** — don't wait for the first cron fire. If it's a slash command, invoke it via the Skill tool; otherwise act on it directly.",

1. **Run the parsed prompt now.** If it's a slash command, invoke it via the Skill tool; otherwise act on it directly.
2. **If the next run is gated on an event** (CI finishing, a log line matching, a file changing, a PR comment) and no Monitor is already running for it: arm one now with `persistent: true`. Its events arrive as `<task-notification>` messages and wake this loop immediately — you do not wait for the ScheduleWakeup deadline. Arm once; on later iterations call TaskList first and skip this step if a monitor is already running.
3. **Briefly confirm**: that you're self-pacing, whether a Monitor is the primary wake signal, that you ran the task now, and what fallback delay you're about to pick. Write this as text *before* calling ScheduleWakeup — the turn ends as soon as that tool returns.
4. **Then, as the last action of this turn, decide whether the loop continues.** If the task needs another iteration, call ScheduleWakeup with:
   - `delaySeconds`: with a Monitor armed this is the **fallback heartbeat** — how long to wait if no event fires (lean 1200–1800s; idle ticks more frequent than the task needs are pure overhead). Without a Monitor this is the cadence — pick based on what you observed. Read the tool's own description for cache-aware delay guidance.
   - `reason`: one short sentence on why you picked that delay.
   - `prompt`: the full original /loop input verbatim, prefixed with `/loop ` so the next firing re-enters this skill and continues the loop. For example, if the user typed `/loop check the deploy`, pass `/loop check the deploy` as the prompt.
   - `noop`: `true` if this tick changed nothing (\"still waiting\", \"quiet hold\"); `false` if it did something worth keeping. Consecutive `noop: true` ticks collapse in the terminal.
   If it doesn't need another iteration, stop instead (step 6) — re-arming is a per-turn choice, not a default.
5. **If you were woken by a `<task-notification>`** rather than this prompt: handle the event in the context of the loop task, then make the same decision. If the loop should continue, call ScheduleWakeup again with the same `prompt` and the same 1200–1800s `delaySeconds` from step 4 (the Monitor remains the wake signal; the new wakeup is only the fallback heartbeat). If the event means the work is finished, stop (step 6).
6. **To stop the loop** — the task is complete, further iterations can't make progress, or the user asked you to stop — call ScheduleWakeup with `stop: true` (no other fields) and TaskStop any Monitor you armed (use TaskList to find the task ID if it is no longer in context).

## Action

1. Convert `{interval}` to a 5-field cron expression. Supported suffixes: `s` → ceil to nearest minute, `m` (minutes), `h` (hours), `d` (days). Examples: `5m` → `*/5 * * * *`, `1h` → `0 * * * *`, `1d` → `0 0 * * *`. If the interval doesn't cleanly divide its unit, round to the nearest clean interval and tell the user what you rounded to.
2. Call {CRON_CREATE} with:
   - `cron`: the expression from step 1
   - `prompt`: the literal string `{sentinel}` — {expands}
   - `recurring`: `true`
3. Briefly confirm: {confirm}
4. **Then immediately run {what} now**, following the instructions inlined below. Don't wait for the first cron fire.
