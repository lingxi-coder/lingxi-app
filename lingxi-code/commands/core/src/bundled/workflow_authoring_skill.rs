//! The `workflow-authoring` bundled skill — port of Claude Code 2.1.267's
//! `dCr()` registrar (`src_185945034.js`).
//!
//! ```js
//! function eFt(){ return [{type:"text", text: wpn()}] }
//! function dCr(){ uo({
//!   name: Iv,                                   // "workflow-authoring"
//!   description: `Reference for writing a ${lu} tool script (…)`,
//!   menuDescription: "Load the reference for writing Workflow tool scripts",
//!   userInvocable: !0,
//!   isEnabled: () => qc(),
//!   async getPromptForCommand(){ return eFt() } }) }
//! ```
//!
//! 2.1.267 moved the 17 KB script-writing reference out of the Workflow tool
//! description and behind this skill, cutting the per-request footprint from
//! about 5.7k tokens to 1k. The text itself lives with the tool
//! (`workflow::description`), which owns both byte-locked
//! oracle documents and the single divergence register that edits them —
//! keeping the `fusion()` entry next to the hooks it belongs with.
//!
//! ⚠️ Divergence: upstream gates registration on `isEnabled: () => qc()`
//! (workflows enabled). This port registers unconditionally, because
//! `register_bundled_skills` does not receive the managed workflow-disable
//! setting and a reference the user can still read while workflows are off is
//! inert, not harmful. Gating it on a predicate the registration site cannot
//! actually see would risk the dangerous direction instead: the skill silently
//! absent while the Workflow description claims it is loadable, which is the
//! one state the reachability invariant forbids.
