//! constants from `claude-code/src/keybindings/schema.ts`.

//! tables (`KEYBINDING_CONTEXTS`, `KEYBINDING_CONTEXT_DESCRIPTIONS`,
//! `KEYBINDING_ACTIONS`) for validation. The zod schema/JSON-schema generation
//! itself is not part of the loader path (it powers the `$schema` editor URL,
//! which the template already references as a static string).
