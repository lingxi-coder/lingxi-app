//! Verified constants from the claude-code reference (see spec §13.2), plus the
//! pure threshold math and token-warning state machine ported from
//! `src/services/compact/autoCompact.ts:30-158`
//! (`getEffectiveContextWindowSize`, `getAutoCompactThreshold`,
//! `calculateTokenWarningState`, `isAutoCompactEnabled`).
//!
//! ## Divergences from TS
//!
//! - `is_auto_compact_enabled` takes the config flag as a `bool` parameter
//!   rather than calling `getGlobalConfig().autoCompactEnabled`. The
//!   `compaction` crate does not depend on a config crate, so the caller reads
//!   `GlobalConfig` and passes the resolved `auto_compact_enabled` flag. The two
//!   env gates (`DISABLE_COMPACT`, `DISABLE_AUTO_COMPACT`) are read here.
//! - `calculate_token_warning_state` takes `auto_compact_enabled: bool` for the
//!   same reason (TS calls `isAutoCompactEnabled()` twice internally).
