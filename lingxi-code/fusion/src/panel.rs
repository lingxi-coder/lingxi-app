///   It is set from the `SubagentObservation::Allocated` the production
///   spawner emits on the line immediately after `pool.allocate` succeeds
///   and BEFORE the runner that makes any provider call exists
///   (`agent/src/handle.rs`). It records a FACT, and it is the only sound
///   predicate for "could this slot have been billed?".
///
/// They differ for seconds at a time: `spawn_workflow_with_observer` runs
/// `build_subagent_context` — which CONNECTS the panel's inline MCP servers
/// — before the pool can even refuse the spawn. A panel parked in that
/// window has `reached = true` and `allocated = false`, and if the panel bar
/// aborts it there (a sibling rejection sealed the run), classifying it as a
/// mid-flight `"aborted"` charges a lifetime spawn slot for a subagent that

/// `overall_deadline` (F004 review fix) is what remains of the end-to-end

/// on another worker cancelling mid-poll, which the multi-threaded runtime
/// the hosts run on (`apps/bridge-server`'s bare `#[tokio::main]`) makes
/// ordinary.
///
/// From there the arm has two exits, and each of its two `sink.update` calls
/// owns one. When the drain finds every remaining task already finished it
/// runs to `None` without yielding back to that outer select, and the
/// trailing update recomputes the committed figure — that conjunction is what
/// `cancel_drain_settles_a_finished_panel_from_its_real_usage_not_the_prompt_floor`
/// constructs, and it is the only state in which the round-9 discard changed
/// the settlement. When the drain instead YIELDS (an aborted task the runtime
/// has not dropped yet), the outer select wins that yield and the trailing
/// update NEVER runs: the only figure that survives is whatever the in-loop
/// update latched from the completions already drained. [Round-11 item N2]
