//! Narrow hook-firer seam for the `TeammateIdle` lifecycle event.
//!
//! The `tasks` crate is a LEAF with no access to a live hook executor: the
//! [`InProcessTeammateHandler`](../../tasks/src/handlers/in_process_teammate.rs)
//! owns the teammate lifecycle (its streaming worker observes the persistent
//! runner's per-turn-set `Completed`, at which point the teammate parks awaiting
//! the next message — "about to go idle") but cannot reach `orch.hooks` without
//! a dependency cycle. This trait closes that seam exactly like
//! [`TaskCompletedFirer`](crate::TaskCompletedFirer): the handler holds an
//! `Option<Arc<dyn TeammateIdleFirer>>` (default `None` => strict no-op) and
//! calls [`fire`](TeammateIdleFirer::fire) each time a turn-set completes and
//! the teammate is about to idle. The narrow [`TeammateIdleOutcome`] return
//! value preserves the only lifecycle signals the caller must act on without
//! leaking the full hook executor aggregate into the leaf task handler.
//!
//! Defining the trait HERE (the `hooks` crate) — rather than in `tasks` — lets
//! the ORCHESTRATOR implement it over its `Arc<HookExecutorImpl>` (the
//! orchestrator depends on `hooks` but NOT on `tasks`, so it could never name a
//! `tasks`-defined trait). The composition root (`engine-desktop`) constructs
//! the impl and injects it where the `InProcessTeammateHandler` is built. This
//! mirrors [`TaskCompletedFirer`] / [`TaskCreatedFirer`](crate::TaskCreatedFirer).
//!
//! Parity: claude-code fires `executeTeammateIdleHooks` (`utils/hooks.ts:3709`)
//! from `stopHooks.ts:403` — after the Stop hooks pass and the teammate's
//! in-progress `TaskCompleted` hooks run — gated on `isTeammate()`, when the
//! teammate's query loop has stopped and it is about to park awaiting the next
//! message. The wire payload (`TeammateIdleHookInputSchema`,
//! `coreSchemas.ts:591-598`) carries `teammate_name` + `team_name` (both
//! required). A blocking hook feeds model-visible feedback back into the
//! teammate so it keeps working; `continue:false` terminates continuation.
