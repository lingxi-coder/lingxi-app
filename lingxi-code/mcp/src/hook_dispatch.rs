//! Hook dispatch seam for inbound MCP requests.
//!
//! The mcp crate is deliberately decoupled from the `hooks` crate: it knows
//! nothing about `HookEvent` / `HookRegistry`. To let an incoming
//! `elicitation/create` consult the `Elicitation` hook (claude-code
//! `services/mcp/elicitationHandler.ts:91-107` + `runElicitationHooks`
//! lines 214-257), we define a NARROW trait here that the orchestrator (which
//! owns the hook registry) implements and injects.
//!
//! The shape is intentionally elicitation-specific rather than a generic
//! `dispatch(HookEvent, HookContext) -> AggregateHookResult` so the mcp crate
//! never has to import hooks types. The orchestrator's adapter translates an
//! [`ElicitationHookRequest`] into a `hooks::HookEvent::Elicitation`, fires the
//! registry, and folds the aggregate back into an [`ElicitationHookOutcome`].
//!
//! Default wiring is `None` => current behavior (strict no-op), matching the
//! `RawConnectionProvider` / auth-provider injection pattern already used by
//! [`crate::McpRegistry`].
