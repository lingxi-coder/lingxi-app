//! LINGXI.md file reader. Skips any file that is not regular or exceeds
//! [`MEMORY_FILE_BYTE_LIMIT`] (4 MiB on bytes), matching claude-code.
//!
//! Beyond the raw [`load_file`] reader this module also ports the
//! claude-code `@import` / `@include` expansion and the per-file body
//! sanitisation (frontmatter + block HTML-comment stripping) so the
//! orchestrator can splice referenced files into the memory block exactly
//! the way the TS reference does. See [`expand_memory_file`].
//!
//! ⚠️ CORRECTION — the paragraph below was wrong, and wrong in the direction
//! that stops someone reinstating a real behaviour. It claimed claude-code
//! applies "no size check" and that any byte cap was `LingXi`-invented. The
//! 2.1.220 BINARY says otherwise: `Eds` (@230805636) routes every memory file
//! through `EG` (@229022173) —
//! `let o=await e.stat(t); if(!o.isFile()||o.size>r) return n?.(o),null;` —
//! with `r = ELu = 4194304` (4 MiB, @230811638, declared in the same run as
//! the `gn_ = 40000` this crate already cites). A non-regular or oversized
//! file is SKIPPED, logged as
//! `[CLAUDE.md] skipping {path}: not a regular file or exceeds {N} byte limit`,
//! and reported once as `file_skipped_special_or_oversize`.
//!
//! The old claim cited `claudemd.ts:424-437` — LEAKED TS, which this repo has
//! repeatedly found stale against the shipped binary. Treat the binary as the
//! oracle here.
//!
//! PORTED: [`load_file`] stats first and returns
//! [`LoaderError::FileTooLarge`] for a non-regular file or one over the limit,
//! which every caller already treats as "no memory file here" — the oracle's
//! `null`. [`report_skipped_memory_file`] then carries the skip line and the
//! one-shot report, matching how the oracle splits `EG` (stat only) from `Eds`
//! (message + report).
//!
//! The report is `Ne("context_claude_md_load","file_skipped_special_or_oversize")`,
//! and `Ne` is thin — `M("tengu_feature_sad",{feature_name, error_code})`
//! (@226537274) — so only that one call is ported here. `Ne`/`be`/`pe` also
//! cover `context_mcp`, `context_git_detect`, `context_management` and the
//! sibling `read_eacces` / `read_failed` / `load_threw` reasons on this very
//! path; that context-load health family is otherwise UNPORTED and is a
//! separate unit of work.
//!
//! Separately from the skip cap, claude-code surfaces a non-blocking warning
//! list for files over
//! [`crate::MAX_MEMORY_CHARACTER_COUNT`] (40k chars) via
//! [`crate::get_large_memory_files`]. The 10 MB drop this loader used to
//! enforce was still not the oracle's rule (the oracle's is 4 MiB on BYTES,
//! before sanitisation) and has been
//! removed.
