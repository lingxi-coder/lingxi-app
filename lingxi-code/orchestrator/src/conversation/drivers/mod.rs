//! Batched, cancelable, and streaming conversation turn drivers.
//!
//! Three public entries — `run_turn`, `run_turn_with_cancel`,
//! `run_turn_streaming` — over two loops. The per-turn work they share lives
//! in the submodules: `prepare` (reminders, the fifteen preparation steps, the
//! prompt snapshot), `loop_state` (`TurnLoopState`, the top-of-loop guards, and
//! the two result types — `StepExit` for how an iteration ended, `TurnEndVerdict`
//! for what the end-of-turn sequence decided) and `disposition` (that sequence
//! and the end-of-turn signal consumption).
//!
//! All three loops have the same outer shape: guards, one round, a match on
//! what it returned. What stays per-entry is what actually differs, and each
//! difference is held by a test that asserts it rather than a comment that
//! describes it: the guard ORDER (`LoopGuardOrder` — the cancelable entry does
//! not drain, streaming checks cancel last), cancel handling, the NAMING of
//! every terminal (§3.2: the same verdict is an `Err` on one entry and an `Ok`
//! on another), and the file-history epilogue, which only the streaming loop
//! runs.
