//! Transcript sink for per-hook-run `attachment` records.
//!
//! claude-code persists exactly ONE `type:"attachment"` transcript line for
//! every hook run. The hooks crate builds the payload
//! ([`hooks::attachment`]); this adapter is the persistence half — it forwards
//! each payload to
//! [`ConversationOrchestrator::persist_hook_attachment_to_jsonl`].
//!
//! # Why a late-bound cell
//!
//! The composition root builds the [`hooks::HookExecutorImpl`] BEFORE the
//! orchestrator exists (the executor is one of the orchestrator's
//! constructor arguments), so the sink cannot be handed a live orchestrator at
//! construction time. It is created empty, wired onto the executor, and
//! [`JsonlHookAttachmentSink::attach`]ed once the orchestrator is built — the
//! same "fill the cell afterwards" shape the subagent spawner's
//! hook-executor handle already uses.
//!
//! The cell holds a [`Weak`] on purpose: the orchestrator owns the hook
//! executor, which owns this sink, so a strong handle back would close a
//! reference cycle and leak the orchestrator for the process's lifetime.
