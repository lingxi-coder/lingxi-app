//! `edited_text_file` — the per-turn "this file changed on disk since you last
//! read it" reminder, and the snippet machinery behind it.
//!
//! Oracle anatomy (offsets into `~/.local/share/claude/versions/2.1.238`):
//!
//! * renderer @ **296733495**:
//!   ```js
//!   edited_text_file:(e)=>{let t=`Note: ${Kae(e.filename)} changed on disk since you last read it. That's usually deliberate, so take it as the current state rather than reverting it; if the change looks wrong, say so rather than undoing it yourself — otherwise no need to call it out.`;
//!    return Zy([kn({content:e.snippet===""?`${t} The diff is omitted here because other changed files this turn already filled the snippet budget; use ${mC.name} if you need the current content.`:`${t} Here are the relevant changes (shown with line numbers):\n${e.snippet}`,isMeta:!0})])}
//!   ```
//!   `Zy` maps `NT` over the message, so the `<system-reminder>` envelope is
//!   applied by the injection site. **This copy is 238 drift**: 2.1.220
//!   (@238102310) said `Note: ${filename} was modified, either by the user or
//!   by a linter. This change was intentional, …`.
//! * producer `Izm(ctx)` @ **296537358** — walks `readFileState`, skips
//!   partial reads (`offset`/`limit` set), skips permission-blocked paths
//!   (`qhe`), re-reads any file whose mtime is newer than the recorded
//!   timestamp through the Read tool, and diffs the recorded content against
//!   the fresh content with `SEf`.
//! * budget tail of `Izm`: `let i=0; for(let s of o){…; if(i>=m3T)s.snippet="";
//!   else i+=s.snippet.length}` with `m3T = 16384` — see
//!   [`apply_snippet_budget`].
//! * `SEf(old,new)` @ **289903016** — `structuredPatch` at **context 8**, each
//!   hunk rendered as its non-removed lines with line numbers starting at
//!   `hunk.oldStart`, hunks joined by `"\n...\n"`, then truncated at
//!   `oKa = 8192` (@289905575) with a `... [N lines truncated] ...` tail.
//! * `rUo({content,startLine,tabAwareSeparator})` @ **282149920** — the
//!   line-number prefixer; `Xcr()` (@288773154, GrowthBook `tengu_tab_read_sep`)
//!   defaults to **false**, so the separator is a TAB unless the caller opts in.
//!
//! **STATUS — PORTED AND WIRED.** The renderer half (byte-exact 238 copy, the
//! two snippet arms, the 16384-char cross-file budget, the line-number
//! prefixer, the 8192-char snippet truncation) plus [`render_snippet`] — the
//! `SEf` diff at context 8 — live here; the PRODUCER is
//! `ConversationOrchestrator::changed_files_reminder_message`, called from the
//! streaming turn driver's per-turn reminder fan-out in `conversation.rs`
//! (positioned after `agent_listing_delta` and before `nested_memory`, the
//! oracle's fan-out order @296520120).
//!
//! Two deliberate deviations from `Izm`, both non-model-visible:
//!
//! * The re-read is a plain filesystem read that REWRITES the `read_file_state`
//!   entry (content + mtime) rather than a nested `Read` tool invocation. The
//!   oracle's re-read exists to refresh the entry so the reminder does not
//!   repeat; doing it directly has the same effect without re-entering the tool
//!   layer (and without emitting a second `readFileState` telemetry event).
//! * `qhe` (the permission-context path filter) has no orchestrator-side
//!   analogue; the producer instead skips anything that is not a readable UTF-8
//!   file, which is the only way a denied path can reach here.
//!
//! Entries recorded from a PARTIAL read (`offset`/`limit` set) are skipped, like
//! the oracle. So are `seeded_from_context` / `is_partial_view` entries: the
//! recorded content for those deliberately differs from disk (frontmatter
//! stripping, token-cap truncation), so a byte compare would fire every turn
//! forever. That is the port's stand-in for the oracle's
//! `truncatedByTokenCap === true` early return plus its `vNe` content compare.
