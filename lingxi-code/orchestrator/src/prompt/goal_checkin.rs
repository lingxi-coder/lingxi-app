//! `goal_checkin` — the goal check-in interstitial, NEW in Claude Code 2.1.238
//! (`CC_VER=2.1.220 oracle.sh count 'Goal check-in'` → **0**).
//!
//! When a goal (`/goal`, the session Stop hook that keeps looping until a
//! condition is met) is active and BACKGROUND WORK is still running, the oracle
//! does not evaluate the goal at all — it removes the goal's Stop hook for that
//! turn and defers. Deferral is not free: once the goal has been deferred for
//! longer than the check-in interval, the model is told, at turn end, that the
//! goal is still there and what is holding it up.
//!
//! Oracle anatomy (offsets into `~/.local/share/claude/versions/2.1.238`):
//!
//! * interval `Zil()` @**292038365**:
//!   ```js
//!   function Zil(){if(!it("tengu_saffron_wren",!0))return 0;
//!     return(V.CLAUDE_CODE_GOAL_CHECKIN_MINUTES??cUv)*60000}
//!   ```
//!   with `cUv = 30` @292041909. The GrowthBook default is **TRUE**, so unlike
//!   most of this family the feature is LIVE in a stock install.
//! * text builder `Szf(condition, deferredMs, tasks)` @**292038578** — see
//!   [`build_checkin_body`].
//! * deferral state machine `Tzf` @**292039748** + `wzf` @**292040130** — see
//!   [`GoalDeferralState::advance`].
//! * the deferring-task filter `_qf` @**292181184**:
//!   ```js
//!   function _qf(e){return Object.values(e).filter((t)=>!rR(t)&&
//!     !(t.type==="local_agent"&&t.agentType==="main-session")&&(xXo(t)||IXo(t)))}
//!   ```
//!   `xXo` = a non-terminal agent-ish task (`j2b = {local_agent, remote_agent,
//!   in_process_teammate, local_workflow}`), `IXo` = a non-terminal `local_bash`,
//!   `rR` = an observer agent.
//! * turn-end call site @**292174788**:
//!   ```js
//!   if(L&&M){let U=_qf(i.taskRegistry.all());
//!     if(U.length>0){ y=…the goal's Stop hook…;
//!       if(y){ i.sessionHooksRegistry.remove(zt(),"Stop",y);   // ⇐ NO evaluation this turn
//!         let W=wzf(L,U,Date.now()); _=W.nextGoal; Z=W.checkinText;
//!         if(Z!==void 0){let W=kn({content:Z,isMeta:!0});S.push(W),h.push(W),yield W}}}
//!     else if(L.deferredSince!==void 0){…clear the deferral fields…}}
//!   ```
//!
//! The check-in body is NOT `<system-reminder>`-wrapped in the oracle — it is a
//! plain `isMeta` user message (`kn({content:checkinText,isMeta:!0})`), unlike
//! the attachment family, which goes through `Zy`/`NT`. The port keeps that.
//!
//! # Divergence (reason)
//!
//! * `bzf(e)` (@292041909 `gsa(pjo(e))`) homoglyph/invisible-character
//!   sanitizes the goal condition and each task label before `Ma`-escaping. The
//!   port has no confusables table, so only the `Ma` half
//!   ([`super::sanitize::escape_reminder_html`]) is applied. The escape that
//!   matters for envelope integrity is present; the anti-spoofing pass is not.
//! * `Tzf`'s new-run detection keys on `Math.min(...tasks.map(t=>t.startTime)) >
//!   lastDeferralPassAt`. The port's Stop-hook `background_tasks` projection
//!   drops `startTime`, so [`GoalDeferralState::advance`] uses the equivalent
//!   predicate over task IDENTITY: every currently-deferring task is one that
//!   was not deferring at the previous pass. Same meaning ("this is a brand-new
//!   batch of background work"), computed from what the port carries.
