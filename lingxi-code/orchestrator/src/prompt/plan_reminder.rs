//! Byte-locked "plan-mode reminder" assembler — INERT (no caller yet).
//!
//! Port of the Claude Code 2.1.206 per-turn plan-mode system-reminder text.
//! The 206 dispatch is:
//! ```js
//! if (e.isSubAgent) return NU_(e);
//! if (e.reminderType === "sparse") return MU_(e);
//! return LU_(e);
//! ```
//! and this module ports the three renderers plus their helpers, byte-for-byte
//! against the 2.1.206 binary
//! (`~/.local/share/claude/versions/2.1.206`):
//!
//! * `NU_`  — subagent reminder            → [`render_subagent`]
//! * `MU_`  — sparse per-turn reminder      → [`render_sparse`]
//! * `LU_`  — full (default) reminder       → [`render_full`]
//! * `OU_`  — "### Phase 4: Final Plan" block (const [`OU_PHASE4`])
//! * `lIp()`— "### Call ExitPlanMode" tail   (const [`LIP_EXIT_TAIL`])
//! * `aIp`  — the full-variant plan-mode banner (const [`AIP_BANNER`])
//! * `Ykp` / `Kkp` / `QVt` — the count / availability helpers.
//!
//! 206 interpolation map → resolved port literals (all inlined below):
//! `gj.name`=`ExitPlanMode`, `Lm`=`AskUserQuestion`, `YI.name`=`Edit`,
//! `pk.name`=`Write`, `iPe.agentType`=`Explore`, `eTo.agentType`=`Plan`.
//! Em-dashes (`\u{2014}`) in the 206 source appear as `—` unicode escapes
//! inside template literals; they render as U+2014 and are emitted as such here.
//!
//! This module is deliberately NOT wired into the turn loop / orchestrator yet
//! (a later unit calls it and wraps the String as an `isMeta` user message), so
//! the default build stays byte-identical.
//!
//! `render_full` keeps the 206 single-letter locals `r`/`n`/`o` (plan count /
//! explore count / subagents-available) for a 1:1 read against `LU_`.
