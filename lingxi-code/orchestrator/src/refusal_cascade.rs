//! Refusal-fallback CASCADE routing (claude-code `qqi` / `jqi` / `FQt`,
//! 2.1.220 @228125792).
//!
//! When a model refuses, the session falls back to another one. Claude does not
//! fall back to a single model — it walks an ordered CHAIN, keyed by the API's
//! refusal category, skipping stages that cannot be resolved (unknown model,
//! or one already tried this episode) until it finds a reachable hop.
//!
//! Two properties make the chain more than a list:
//!
//! - **Already-tried stages are skipped.** Without that a cascade could loop
//!   back onto the model that just refused, or re-try a hop that already
//!   refused earlier in the same episode.
//! - **Every skipped stage is REPORTED** (one
//!   `tengu_refusal_fallback_route_declined` per stage, reason
//!   `chain_entry_unresolvable`, carrying its index). A chain that silently
//!   degrades to its last entry is indistinguishable from a chain that worked,
//!   which is exactly the case an operator needs to see.
//!
//! This module is the routing decision only — pure, and independent of the turn
//! loop. It is also the substrate the refusal-notice collapse needs: a hop that
//! a LATER hop supersedes is what makes a notice provisional
//! (`docs/refusal-retraction-DECOMPOSITION-2026-07-26.md`).
