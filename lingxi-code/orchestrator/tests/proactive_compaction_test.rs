//! In-Loop Compaction Batch 4 — proactive pre-call compaction trigger.
//!
//! Verifies that the batched turn loop runs the proactive
//! snip+micro+autocompact pass BEFORE each model call (TS pre-call pipeline
//! `query.ts:365-467`):
//!
//! - With a compactor wired at a low test threshold and a history already over
//!   that threshold, running a turn compacts history (boundary marker present),
//!   the FIRST `messages_create` carries the compacted (not the seeded) history,
//!   and a `CompactionCompleted` event is emitted.
//! - With the history under the threshold (or no compactor wired), the trigger
//!   is a strict NO-OP: history is identical and no `CompactionCompleted` fires.
