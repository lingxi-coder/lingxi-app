//! Anti-drift: every per-turn reminder must reach BOTH turn drivers.
//!
//! claude-code has ONE main loop. LingXi has two — the batched `turn_loop.rs`
//! and the streaming driver under `conversation/drivers` — and a reminder wired
//! into only one of them is invisible in exactly one mode. That failure is
//! silent: the feature works when you test it, and does nothing in production
//! if production runs the other driver.
//!
//! The two drivers now share ONE collector (`conversation/drivers/prepare.rs`),
//! so the shape of the check moved with it. Instead of counting the same
//! producer in two hand-maintained fan-outs, it pins the two halves that
//! replaced them:
//!
//! 1. the shared collector invokes every producer exactly once, and
//! 2. each driver routes through that collector exactly once, and reaches NO
//!    producer behind its back.
//!
//! Half 2 is what keeps half 1 meaningful: a shared collector nothing calls is
//! the same silent regression in a new costume, and a reminder open-coded into
//! one driver instead of the collector is the original bug exactly.
//!
//! This is a SOURCE-level check, and it is honest about being weak: it proves
//! each producer is reached, not that the message is pushed in the right
//! position or at all. `tests/streaming_vs_batched_equivalence_test.rs` drives
//! both real entries and pins the ORDER of the producers that fire there; note
//! that its byte-equality assertion cannot see a reorder INSIDE the collector,
//! because one function feeds both paths. Order is pinned by that file's
//! `assert_shared_reminder_order`, not by cross-path equality.
