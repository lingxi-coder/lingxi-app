//! §3.2, the late-cancel rows: a token that fires AFTER the model step already
//! succeeded.
//!
//! The two entries answer differently, and §3.2 records both:
//!
//!   Batched: 成功返回后晚到取消 — 不追加一次 token 检查，保留已完成的
//!            EndTurn，不覆盖成 Cancelled
//!   Streaming: 成功返回后晚到取消 — 主 streaming 包装可将成功 EndTurn /
//!              StopHookPrevented 映射为 Cancelled
//!
//! §8's risk table states the direction of the danger outright: "Streaming 包装
//! 把晚到取消映射为 Cancelled，batched 没有 … 禁止在 batched 最终 return 探测
//! token." PR 5 unifies the entry wrappers, and a single shared "was the token
//! cancelled?" check at the end is the obvious way to write one. It would hand
//! batched a mapping it has never had, and the symptom is a turn that finished
//! its work being reported as cancelled — the work is done, persisted, and the
//! caller is told it did not happen.
//!
//! "Late" is made deterministic rather than raced: the provider cancels the
//! token as a side effect and THEN returns a successful response, so by the time
//! the step resolves the token is already cancelled. No sleeps, no ordering
//! assumptions.

// ── §3.5 cancel-before-max_turns: NOT deterministically testable ────────────
//
// Attempted and removed rather than shipped. The two guards can only both be
// true from the second loop iteration onward — at the first top `turn_count` is
// 0, so `0 >= max_turns` is false for any real limit. Reaching a second top with
// the token already set needs the cancel to land BETWEEN rounds, and on this
// path there is no such window: the `select!` races the whole step, so a cancel
// arriving during one is taken there, and a cancel arriving before the loop is
// the pre-cancel case where `max_turns` cannot also trip.
//
// The fixture that looked like it worked — a tool that cancels the token, with
// `max_turns: 1` — ends in iteration ONE (measured: one API call), so the
// max-turns guard never runs and the assertion about cancel beating it was
// vacuous. Both cancel branches were probed and neither mattered, which is what
// exposed it.
//
// Left here as a note rather than a test, because a test whose premise is false
// is worse than no test: it reports coverage of an ordering nothing checks.
