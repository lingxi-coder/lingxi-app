//! Admission tests for PR 3 of the unified-driver plan (shared `TurnLoopState`).
//!
//! §5.1 names what the extraction must not disturb: "共享构造保留
//! `query_started_at` 与 `turn_start_output_baseline` 时点。入口追加、
//! UserPromptSubmit 阻止、`begin_output_turn`、state 初始化的相对顺序不得因抽取
//! 改变." PR 3's own line is "锁定 baseline、计数器重置、token 字段".
//!
//! All three entries already agree on the order — `begin_output_turn` first,
//! then the baseline — but they reach it differently: streaming inside
//! `TurnLoopState::new`, the two batched entries inline in the public
//! wrapper. A single shared constructor has to land on the same instant for all
//! three, and "the same instant" is only checkable while something pins it.
//!
//! The baseline is what makes per-turn output-token accounting a DELTA rather
//! than a running total: budget continuation and the Stop-hook gates read
//! `pool - baseline`. Capturing it a moment too late (after the first model
//! step, say) silently reports every turn as having produced nothing, and no
//! test that only counts messages would notice.
