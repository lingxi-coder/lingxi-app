//! WIZARD-06 — the shipped auto-mode default slots (2.1.220).
//!
//! `bmt()` reads these four `<user_*_to_replace>` slots out of the auto-mode
//! classifier prompt template. Two ported call sites consume them:
//!
//! * [`crate::auto_mode_propose::build_propose_prompt`] appends
//!   [`DEFAULT_ENVIRONMENT`] verbatim as the prompt's shipped-defaults trailer.
//! * The recon's "Shipped default auto-mode rule labels" section lists the
//!   `allow` and `soft_deny` LABELS, so a proposal does not duplicate coverage
//!   the defaults already have.
//!
//! The rule slots are stored as the labels `fPo` reduces them to
//! ([`default_rule_label`]) rather than as their full prose: the full text is
//! only ever read through that reduction here, since this workspace ships a
//! deterministic offline classifier instead of the prompt these slots belong
//! to. Both call sites therefore produce byte-identical output.
