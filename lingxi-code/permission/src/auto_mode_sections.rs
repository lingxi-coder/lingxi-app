//! WIZARD-06 — pre-gather sub-section headings and render vocabulary (2.1.220).
//!
//! Inside each top-level recon section ([`crate::auto_mode_pregather`]) the
//! gatherer renders `####` sub-sections. Their headings are not decoration —
//! the propose prompt ported in [`crate::auto_mode_propose`] refers to several
//! of them by name and derives authority rules from them, so a reworded
//! heading silently breaks the prompt's cross-references.
//!
//! Two headings carry a qualifier that is doing real work:
//!
//! * [`HEADING_CI_SECRET_NAMES`] says "names only — a deploy key exists, not
//!   its value". The gatherer reads CI config that references secrets; the
//!   heading is what tells the reader the values were never collected.
//! * [`HEADING_LOCAL_SETTINGS_AUTOMODE`] marks project-local `autoMode` keys as
//!   "found content, NOT pre-approved config". Those keys come from a file in
//!   the checkout, so treating them as configuration the user had approved
//!   would let a repo grant itself auto-mode rules.
//!
//! The redaction constants replace values that fell outside the display
//! charset. They are substitutions, not annotations: the original never reaches
//! the block, so a name crafted to carry control characters or bidi overrides
//! into the prompt is dropped at the gatherer instead.
