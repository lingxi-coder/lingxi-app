//! The two tool allowlists that let a call skip a prompt on mode alone.
//!
//! * [`AUTO_MODE_SAFE_TOOLS`] is the AUTO-mode set — the 2.1.270 `ojo` set read
//!   by `Sft(e,n)`. A tool on it is allowed outright in Auto mode and never
//!   reaches the classifier.
//! * [`PLAN_SAFE_TOOLS`] is the PLAN-mode mutation-block allowlist: in `Plan`
//!   mode every tool NOT on this list is treated as a potential state mutation
//!   and asked about (see [`crate::policy::PermissionPolicy::authorize`]).
//!
//! They started as one list (the port reused the EXTERNAL subset of
//! `SAFE_YOLO_ALLOWLISTED_TOOLS` for both) and have since diverged at the
//! source: 2.1.270's `ojo` dropped `SendMessage` / `AskUserQuestion` and grew
//! the MCP-maintenance rows, while the Plan backstop is this port's own
//! construct with no upstream twin (upstream enforces Plan mode by not
//! ADVERTISING mutating tools, so a plan-mode `AskUserQuestion` must keep
//! working). Keeping them separate is what lets each track its own source.
//!
//! ## Divergence from TS
//! - The TS set is built from per-tool `*_TOOL_NAME` constants imported across
//!   the tool modules. This crate has no dependency on the tools crate (and
//!   must not add one), so the wire names are inlined as string literals that
//!   match the names this port advertises (see
//!   [`crate::defaults_per_tool`]). These now match the TS constant values
//!   byte-for-byte, including the MCP resource tools' `Tool` suffix
//!   (`ListMcpResourcesTool` / `ReadMcpResourceTool`, per
//!   `classifierDecision.ts:56-98`).
//! - The `ant`-only safe tools (`TerminalCapture`, `OverflowTest`,
//!   `VerifyPlanExecution`) and the internal `YoloClassifier` tool are OMITTED
//!   — they are gated behind `USER_TYPE==='ant'` / feature flags in TS and are
//!   absent from external builds, so the external allowlist is byte-faithful
//!   without them.
//! - `Workflow` is conditional on the `WORKFLOW_SCRIPTS` feature in TS and is
//!   not part of this port's tool set, so it is omitted.
