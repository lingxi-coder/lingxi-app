//! Guest→host path translation for permission checks.
//!
//! MOBILE DIVERGENCE. There is no oracle counterpart: claude-code 2.1.235 has
//! a single filesystem coordinate space, so `filesystem.ts` never has to ask
//! "which side of a mount is this path on".
//!
//! On mobile the model names files in GUEST coordinates (`/workspace/<id>/…`,
//! the same spelling the shell and the file tools use) while every root in
//! [`crate::FsRoots`] is a HOST path. `expand_path` keeps an absolute path
//! verbatim, so `path_matches_rule_pattern` relativizes a guest path against a
//! host root, gets a `../`-prefixed string, and bails — no allow rule can ever
//! match and every edit prompts. Measured on device:
//!
//! ```text
//! host_cwd  = /private/var/mobile/Containers/Data/Application/…/LingxiCode
//! model_cwd = /workspace/30c17980-f397-434b-8dba-4c3690a9f60a
//! ```
//!
//! The fix reuses the SAME `translate_model_path` seam the file tools call
//! (`tools/file/src/write.rs`, `edit.rs`), so the gate and the tool can never
//! disagree about which mount a path belongs to.
