//! `permissions.blockReadsOutsideWorkingDirectories` — the Bash-side producers.
//!
//! The file-tool gate lives in [`crate::policy`] (`sc`); this module holds the
//! shapes the SHELL path uses, where an outside-the-working-directories read is
//! reported as a `safetyCheck` carrying
//! [`SafetyCircuitBreaker::OutsideReadsBlocked`] rather than as `sc`'s
//! `type:"other"` deny.
//!
//! Oracle helpers (2.1.263), byte-locked below:
//!
//! ```js
//! function uL(e){ return e?.type==="safetyCheck" && e.circuitBreaker==="outsideReadsBlocked" }
//!
//! function Op(e){ let o=`${e} names a path that is computed at run time, which cannot be checked against the read block (permissions.blockReadsOutsideWorkingDirectories)`;
//!   return {behavior:"ask", message:o, decisionReason:{type:"safetyCheck", reason:o, classifierApprovable:!1, circuitBreaker:"outsideReadsBlocked"}} }
//!
//! function zU(e){ let o=`${e}; under the read block (permissions.blockReadsOutsideWorkingDirectories) a command the shell parser cannot analyze asks the person`;
//!   return {behavior:"ask", message:o, decisionReason:{…same…}, suggestions:[]} }
//! ```
//!
//! Note both builders put the SAME string in `message` and in
//! `decisionReason.reason` — they are not two different texts.
