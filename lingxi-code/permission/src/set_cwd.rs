//! The `set_cwd` control request — changing a live session's working directory
//! across the TRUST boundary.
//!
//! A control-channel client can move the session to another directory. That is
//! a privilege change, not a cosmetic one: the new directory's files become
//! readable and writable under the session's rules, so an untrusted directory
//! must be confirmed by the user before the move happens.
//!
//! This module is the decision half — validation, the trust handshake, and the
//! byte-exact rejection shapes. The caller performs the actual move (and the
//! transcript relocation) only once this returns [`SetCwdDecision::Proceed`].
//!
//! ## The handshake
//!
//! An untrusted target answers [`SetCwdResponse::NeedsTrust`], carrying the
//! resolved `directory` and — when it differs and is itself safe to echo — the
//! `trust_root` the client should offer to trust instead (the enclosing project
//! root, so a user trusting `~/code/app/src` is offered `~/code/app`).
//!
//! The client then retries with `trust_accepted: true` AND
//! `trusted_directory` echoing the directory it showed the user. The echo is
//! the load-bearing part: it pins the confirmation to the exact path that was
//! displayed, so a directory swapped between the prompt and the retry does not
//! inherit a confirmation the user gave for something else.
