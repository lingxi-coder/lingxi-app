//! [`ParkedAgentStore`] — the seam that makes a backgrounded agent restorable
//! after the process that ran it exits.
//!
//! `TaskRegistry` is in-memory, so a parked background agent's LAUNCH
//! configuration — model, cwd, isolation, depth, agent type — died with the
//! process even though its conversation and (for a forked skill) its permission
//! scoping were already on disk. A restarted process could read what an agent
//! had said and had no idea how to start it again.
//!
//! A seam rather than a direct call because the store needs the session
//! directory, which lives at the composition root, while the park/unpark
//! moments are down in the task handler.
//!
//! ## The contract is absence-means-terminal
//!
//! [`park`](ParkedAgentStore::park) is called each time an agent COMES TO REST
//! — the only point a resume can target, because the agent is idle between
//! turn-sets with a complete transcript — and
//! [`unpark`](ParkedAgentStore::unpark) when it reaches a terminal state.
//! A restore therefore relies on the ABSENCE of a record rather than on a
//! status field, so a reader cannot forget to check one and revive a finished
//! agent.
