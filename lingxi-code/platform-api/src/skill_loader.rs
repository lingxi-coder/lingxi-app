//! Skill-loader seam (G5 subagent skill preloading).
//!
//! claude-code's `runAgent` preloads each skill named in an agent's frontmatter
//! `skills:` list into the child's INITIAL messages before the query loop
//! (`runAgent.ts:577-646`): it resolves the skill name (exact / plugin-prefix /
//! suffix), loads its prompt content (`skill.getPromptForCommand('', ctx)`), and
//! pushes a `isMeta` user message whose first block is
//! `formatSkillLoadingMetadata(skillName, skill.progressMessage)` followed by the
//! loaded content blocks.
//!
//! The agent runner cannot reach the skill registry directly: that lives in
//! `commands-core` / the `Skill` tool crate, which (transitively) depend on the
//! agent/tool stack — a direct dep would cycle. This LEAF trait
//! ([`SkillLoader`]) is the injection seam: the composition root (engine-desktop)
//! constructs a concrete impl over the live skill/command registry and hands it
//! to the spawner via `Arc<dyn SkillLoader>`; the runner calls
//! [`SkillLoader::resolve_and_load`] without taking the cyclic dep. When no
//! loader is wired (tests / minimal builds) the runner skips skill preloading
//! entirely, keeping the child's history byte-identical to legacy.
