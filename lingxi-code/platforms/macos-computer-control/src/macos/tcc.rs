//! macOS TCC permission probes (Accessibility + Screen Recording).
//!
//! Parity target: `cu.tcc.checkAccessibility()` / `checkScreenRecording()`
//! (Swift, via a private-ish but Apple-documented pair of public C functions).
//! Both are simple no-argument boolean queries, so a raw `extern "C"` binding
//! is simpler and lighter than pulling in a whole accessibility crate for two
//! functions.
//!
//! Both bindings use the REQUEST variant, not the read-only preflight/query
//! variant, even though this function is conceptually a "check" — found via
//! live interactive testing of the `request_access` TCC panel: with the
//! read-only `CGPreflightScreenCaptureAccess()` this crate originally used,
//! nothing ever actually asks the OS for Screen Recording access, so macOS
//! never adds this process to System Settings → Screen & System Audio
//! Recording — the panel's "Open System Settings → Screen Recording" row
//! sends the user to a list with no entry to toggle on at all, a dead end.
//! Both `AXIsProcessTrustedWithOptions` (with the prompt option) and
//! `CGRequestScreenCaptureAccess` are documented by Apple as idempotent
//! after the first decision: once the user has answered (via the native
//! prompt this triggers, or a manual System Settings toggle), later calls
//! just return the current status without re-prompting — so it is safe to
//! call this on every single `request_access` invocation, not just once.
