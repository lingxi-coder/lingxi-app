//! Production POSIX platform crate (Linux + macOS).
//!
//! Implements `lingxi-traits` interfaces using real OS APIs. Replaces the
//! M1 `posix-minimal` crate for desktop runnable scenarios.
//!
//! ## `unsafe_code`
//!
//! The workspace lint is `deny(unsafe_code)`. Exactly one module in this
//! crate — [`process::spawn_unsafe`] — opts into `#![allow(unsafe_code)]`
//! for a single call to `libc::setsid()` from `CommandExt::pre_exec`. That
//! call is required so the background-spawned child becomes a process-group
//! leader, which lets [`process::kill_tree::kill_tree_unix`] tree-kill its
//! descendants via `killpg(2)`. See plan
//! `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-23-m2-06-securestorage-sse-process.md`
//! Tasks 14-15.

// Documentation debt, not a decision that docs do not matter: this crate had
// 12 undocumented public item(s) when `missing_docs` was measured across the
// workspace (2026-09-16). The lint stays `warn` at the workspace level so a NEW
// crate still inherits the requirement; this allow is scoped here so the debt
// is visible per crate and can be repaid one crate at a time by deleting this
// line.
#![allow(missing_docs)]
// Dead code kept visible, not swept: this crate had 12 item(s) rustc could
// reach from nothing when the workspace was measured (2026-09-16). The lint
// stays `warn` at the workspace level so a NEW crate still inherits it; this
// allow is scoped here so the count is per crate and repayable by deleting this
// line. This is the category where "named, computed, never wired" hides — some
// of these read like features that were built and never connected. Each wants a
// decision (delete, or wire), not a blanket deletion.
