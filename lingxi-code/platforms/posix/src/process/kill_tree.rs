//! Tree-kill via `killpg(2)` on Unix.
//!
//! Children spawned with `setsid()` (see [`super::spawn_unsafe::attach_setsid`])
//! are process-group leaders — their PID equals their PGID. We pass the
//! POSITIVE PGID to `killpg(2)`, which delivers the signal to every member
//! of the group, including any descendants the child has forked.
//!
//! Sequence: SIGTERM → 5 s grace → SIGKILL. Matches claude-code's
//! `treeKill(pid, 'SIGKILL')` semantics but with a polite SIGTERM first
//! (the node `tree-kill` library's default sequence is similar).
