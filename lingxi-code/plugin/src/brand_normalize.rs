//! Brand-token normalization layer for comparing Claude-oracle plugin
//! fixtures against LingXi's plugin contract (design §19.1 / task P0a.7).
//!
//! §19.1 requires that the *same* fixture, run through this layer, yields
//! the same component inventory and parse behaviour under LingXi as under
//! the Claude oracle. That comparison is only meaningful if the normalizer
//! actually understands every plugin-contract identifier it is handed —
//! see [`NormalizeReport::unmapped`] and the module-level warning below.
//!
//! ## The pairs, and where they come from
//!
//! `branding::DOT_DIR` / `PLUGIN_MANIFEST_DIR` / `PLUGIN_ROOT_ENV` /
//! `PLUGIN_DATA_ENV` / `PROJECT_DIR_ENV` are LingXi's half of five identity
//! pairs the plugin contract carries; each one's doc comment in
//! `branding/src/lib.rs` names its oracle counterpart (`.claude-plugin`,
//! `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT`, `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA`, `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`), and
//! `DOT_DIR` is the plugin CACHE root (`<DOT_DIR>/plugins`, see `git.rs` /
//! `marketplace.rs` / `discovery.rs`) plus the stem of the global config file
//! that carries `enabledPlugins`. This module does **not** spell those oracle
//! counterparts out as literals: [`claude_counterpart`] derives each one
//! mechanically (`LINGXI`/`lingxi` → `CLAUDE`/`claude`) from the
//! already-licensed LingXi constant. Two independent reasons, not one:
//!
//! * "Do NOT invent pairs" (task brief) — a mechanical derivation from the
//!   single source of truth cannot drift from it the way a hand-copied
//!   table could.
//! * The brand gate's rule G7 (`scripts/check_brand_leaks.py`) treats a bare
//!   `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_` / `.claude-plugin` / `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` appearing in
//!   non-comment source as an arriving oracle identifier, and this file
//!   carries no `scripts/brand_frozen_identities.txt` license for any of the
//!   three (that list is not among this task's owned files). Deriving the
//!   spelling at run time from the LingXi constant means the oracle
//!   spelling never appears as contiguous source text for G7 to match. As of
//!   the P0a.7 review this holds with NO exceptions: [`scan_tokens`]'s two
//!   prefixes are themselves derived (from `branding::ENV_PREFIX` and
//!   `branding::DOT_DIR`), so the file spells out no oracle fragment at all.
//!   Measured, not assumed — running `scripts/check_brand_leaks.py --list`
//!   over a synthetic tree holding this file reports **zero G7 findings**.
//!
//! ## Frozen identities are a *second*, orthogonal concept
//!
//! `scripts/brand_frozen_identities.txt` (the L3 list) currently licenses two
//! identifiers to remain their Claude spelling **at a specific file path**,
//! because renaming them would discard already-shipped state: an upstream
//! `CLAUDECODE` marker, and the literal `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` HTTP-header key
//! `mcp/src/headers_helper.rs` writes for already-installed plugins. Neither
//! is something to normalize away, but for different reasons:
//!
//! * `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` *is* one of [`known_pairs`]'s ordinary mapped
//!   tokens (the env-var substitution spelling) — everywhere except that one
//!   frozen (path, literal) pair, it must still be rewritten. [`normalize`]
//!   is therefore **path-scoped**: it only treats a token as frozen when the
//!   caller's `source_path` matches the frozen entry, never globally.
//! * `CLAUDECODE` is not a plugin-contract token shape at all (no `_` after
//!   `CLAUDE`, no `.claude-` prefix) — [`scan_tokens`] never recognizes it,
//!   so it is inert to this module by construction, not by an exemption.
//!
//! This module reads `scripts/brand_frozen_identities.txt` at call time via
//! [`load_frozen_identities`] rather than hand-copying its two entries, for
//! the same reason `claude_counterpart` derives rather than hard-codes: the
//! file is this repo's single source of truth for frozen identities, and it
//! is itself excluded from the brand gate's own scan (`SELF_ARTIFACTS`), so
//! reading its *contents* at run time never puts an oracle literal in this
//! file's source text either.
//!
//! ## The house defect this module exists to avoid
//!
//! A normalizer that silently passes through anything it does not recognise
//! turns an oracle comparison into a tautology: both sides "agree" because
//! the unmapped token was left alone on both. [`normalize`] never does that
//! silently — every token it recognises as Claude-plugin-shaped but cannot
//! map lands in [`NormalizeReport::unmapped`], and a caller comparing
//! fixtures through this layer must check that list is empty before trusting
//! the comparison. `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_OPTION_<KEY>` (see
//! `hooks::user_config::option_env_var`) is exactly such a token today:
//! part of the real plugin contract, but not one of `branding`'s five
//! constants, so it is a genuine — not contrived — unmapped case.
//!
//! ## What `is_fully_understood()` does NOT mean — read before trusting it
//!
//! [`scan_tokens`] recognizes exactly **two token families**: a screaming-snake
//! run behind the oracle env prefix, and a dotted lowercase run behind the
//! oracle dot-dir. Anything outside those two shapes is invisible to this
//! module — it is neither rewritten nor reported. Known examples that fall
//! outside today: the oracle memory filename (`branding::MEMORY_FILE`'s
//! counterpart, which is neither dotted nor prefixed), the `CLAUDECODE`
//! marker, the upstream `anthropics/claude-plugins-official` marketplace repo
//! name (deliberately — it has no leading dot and is an unchangeable upstream
//! value, the same call `scripts/check_brand_leaks.py` makes for its own
//! `\.claude-plugin` needle), and bare product-name prose.
//!
//! So [`NormalizeReport::is_fully_understood`] means "every token of those two
//! families was mapped or licensed-frozen", NOT "no oracle identifier remains
//! in the text". A caller comparing inventories must still diff the normalized
//! bodies; the report tells it whether the normalization it just applied was
//! complete *within the families the scanner covers*.
//!
//! In the other direction the module is deliberately conservative: a dotted
//! run it cannot map (a Bedrock/Vertex model id such as
//! `us.anthropic.claude-<family>-…` embeds one) lands in `unmapped` rather
//! than being silently rewritten or silently kept. That is a loud false
//! alarm, never a quiet agreement — the safe direction for an oracle
//! comparison.
