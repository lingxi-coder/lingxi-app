//! `PluginManager` — drives the lifecycle state machine and materialises
//! plugin components into the engine registries (tools, hooks, MCP, agent,
//! skill, command, output-style, LSP), plus the shared Monitor task registry.
//!
//! `enable` materialises commands, hooks, agents (frontmatter-gated),
//! skills, output-styles, LSP servers, MCP servers (live-connected
//! through the same `McpRegistry::connect_all` path as normal configured
//! `.mcp.json` servers), and `always` plugin monitors (through
//! `TaskRegistryHandle::spawn_monitor`). `disable` symmetrically removes
//! registry entries while retaining already-running monitors until session end.
//!
//! `install`'s local-path arm discovers + enables a pre-fetched plugin dir in
//! place — the only arm anything outside this crate's own tests calls. The
//! network arms (`Marketplace`/`Git`/`Mcpb`) deliberately return a
//! "use the CLI installer" error rather than fetching anything: production
//! installs a plugin exclusively through
//! `apps/cli/src/commands/plugin_install.rs`'s own git-clone / npm-install /
//! archive-download materialization, which writes the real V2
//! `installed_plugins.json` shape. An earlier revision of this module
//! duplicated that fetch machinery end-to-end (git clone, marketplace-catalog
//! resolution, `.mcpb` unpack, and its own `installed_plugins.json` writer)
//! with zero production callers; its writer used an INCOMPATIBLE
//! `{version, added}` record shape that would have corrupted the real file
//! had anything ever wired it up (spec §25d). It was deleted rather than
//! kept "just in case" once analysis showed every guard it uniquely had —
//! the marketplace cache-escape check — already has an equivalent in the
//! production path (see `marketplace_entry_source_path` in
//! `plugin_install.rs`).
//!
//! See spec §15.3.
