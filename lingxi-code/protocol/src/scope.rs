//! The one scope vocabulary.
//!
//! Before this module the engine modelled "which rung does this configuration
//! sit on" twenty-four separate times — `SettingsLayer`, `HookSource`,
//! `SkillSource`, `CommandSource`, `ConfigScope`, `MemoryTier`, … — across
//! twenty-one crates. They drifted, and the drift has already cost a bug:
//! `permission`'s citation ladder once ranked `session` highest, the reverse of
//! the reference implementation.
//!
//! Three facts were tangled together in those enums. This module separates
//! them:
//!
//! 1. [`Scope`] — **which store** the thing lives in (`~/.lingxi/`, the project
//!    tree, the binary, this session's memory, …).
//! 2. [`Origin`] — **what delivered it** (a plugin, an MCP server, an agent's
//!    front-matter, …). Orthogonal to the rung: a project-level plugin's hook
//!    is `(Scope::Project, Origin::Plugin(id))`, a sentence the old enums could
//!    not express because both facts fought for the same variant.
//! 3. Resolved locations (`repo_root`, `team_dir`, …) — deliberately NOT here.
//!    Those belong to whichever crate resolved them, next to a [`Scope`] field.
//!
//! # `Scope` is unordered on purpose
//!
//! It would be natural to `derive(PartialOrd, Ord)` here and call the result
//! "the precedence ladder". That would be wrong, and the codebase proves it:
//! the same rungs are ordered several mutually contradictory ways, each
//! correct for its own question.
//!
//! | Question | `User` vs `Project` vs `Local` |
//! |---|---|
//! | Which settings *value* wins? | `Local` > `Project` > `User` |
//! | Which rule does a denial *cite*? | `User` > `Project` > `Local` |
//! | What order is `LINGXI.md` spliced in? | `User` before `Project` before `Local` |
//!
//! The first two are exact opposites and both match the reference
//! implementation — value-precedence and citation-precedence are genuinely
//! different axes. A derived `Ord` would silently pick one and invert the
//! others, which is the same failure that produced the original bug, only
//! harder to see.
//!
//! So: **`Scope` carries identity, never order.** Each question owns a named
//! ordering function next to the code that asks it, and each such function owns
//! a test pinning the pairs it depends on. The `scope_is_not_ordered` test
//! below keeps a comparison trait from being derived here.
