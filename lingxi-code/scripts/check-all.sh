# trigger for P1.12 (see docs/local-apps/... review history: three of these
# gates shipped with 0 automation triggers and only human memory ran them).
#
# DISCOVERY, NOT A HARDCODED LIST. Gates are found by walking scripts/
# (this directory only — not lap_gate_fixtures/, not mobile-linux/) for
# executable files matching the naming convention every gate wrapper in
# this repo already follows: `check-*.sh` or `*-gate.sh`. That convention
# is the whole point: a fifth gate written tomorrow by someone who has
# never heard of this finding gets picked up automatically, because it is
# discovered from the filesystem, not looked up in a list this file would
# need editing to extend. scripts/test_gate_triggers.py enumerates the same
# directory independently and cross-checks it against what actually ran.
#
# Each gate is invoked for real — `exec`'d as a child process, its stdout
# captured and echoed — never just named in a comment. A trigger that only
# MENTIONS a filename (e.g. a stray comment, a doc reference) is exactly
# the failure mode this script exists to not be; grep for evidence of that
# distinction in test_gate_triggers.py.

# All five gate wrappers resolve their own engine path via `cd
# "$(dirname "$0")/.."` + a path relative to the NEW cwd. That only
# resolves correctly when invoked as `./scripts/<name>.sh` from the
# lingxi-code/ root (the same convention .github/workflows/ci.yml already
# uses for check-deps.sh) — not from inside scripts/ itself, and not via
# an absolute path. So: cd to lingxi-code/ once, then always invoke
# `./scripts/<name>` — never `./"$name"` from inside this directory.
