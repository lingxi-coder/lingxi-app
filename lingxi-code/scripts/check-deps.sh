# M8-P14 — dependency-graph CI gate.
#
# Enforces the composition-root architecture (design §8.1): library crates make
# no shipping choices, so dependency edges must flow strictly "downhill". Reads
# declared workspace deps via `cargo metadata --no-deps` (offline-safe — the
# full resolve isn't needed; only *direct* workspace edges are checked) and
# fails CI if any crate depends in a forbidden direction.
#
# Rules (per crate class, by directory):
#   tool      (tools/<x>)        ✗ tool ✗ platform ✗ skill ✗ command ✗ app
#   platform  (platforms/<x>)    ✗ tool ✗ skill ✗ command ✗ app   (sibling platform + engine OK)
#   skill     (skills/<x>)       ✗ tool ✗ platform ✗ command ✗ app
#   command   (commands/<x>)     ✗ tool ✗ platform ✗ app ✗ sibling-command
#   engine    (root-level)       ✗ tool ✗ platform ✗ skill ✗ command ✗ app ✗ monolith
#   GLOBAL                       ✗ any non-leaf crate depending on an app/example leaf
#
# Exemptions: the legacy `tools` monolith aggregator + test-fixture crates.
#
# Usage: scripts/check-deps.sh [--list]
