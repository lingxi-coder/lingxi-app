//! Forked-skill scoping sidecars — the two files that sit beside a forked
//! skill's session transcript and let a LATER resume re-establish the exact
//! permission scoping the fork ran under.
//!
//! A skill declaring `context: fork` runs as a background subagent under the
//! skill's own `allowed-tools` / `disallowed-tools` rather than the parent's.
//! That scoping is not derivable from the transcript, so resuming such an agent
//! without it would silently widen its permissions. Claude-code writes it to
//! disk at fork time and REFUSES to resume when it cannot be corroborated —
//! this module is the read/write half of that contract; the refusals live with
//! the resume path.
//!
//! Two files, both derived from the session JSONL path (claude `qon`):
//!
//! | file | claude | content |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `<uuid>.forked-skill.json` | `scoping` | the [`ForkedSkillScoping`] record |
//! | `<uuid>.forked-skill.marker.json` | `provenanceMarker` | `{"forkedSkill":true,"skillName":…}` |
//!
//! The marker exists so a MISSING scoping record is distinguishable from a
//! never-forked agent: an agent with a marker but no scoping is
//! [`ScopingStatus::AbsentButMarked`], which the resume path refuses, while a
//! plain agent is [`ScopingStatus::Absent`], which it allows. Without the
//! marker, deleting the scoping file would downgrade a forked skill to an
//! unscoped resume — the marker turns that deletion into a hard failure.
//!
//! Both reads use `lstat` (claude `u7e.lstat`), NOT `stat`: a symlink planted
//! at either path reports `is_file() == false` and is rejected as
//! [`ScopingStatus::Malformed`] rather than followed to whatever it points at.
