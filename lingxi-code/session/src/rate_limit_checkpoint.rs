//! Rate-limit resume checkpoint — the `RESUME.md` document, its vocabulary,
//! and the git executor that publishes it.
//!
//! SC-02. New in 2.1.238 (`performRateLimitCheckpoint` has 6 hits there and
//! **0** in 2.1.220): when a session hits — or nears — its usage limit, the
//! oracle snapshots the working tree into a detached WIP commit under a private
//! ref, writes a human-readable `RESUME.md` explaining how to pick the session
//! back up, and hands the user the ref that holds their in-progress files.
//!
//! Oracle module `eal` (cc-238.js @292197753) exports exactly:
//!
//! ```text
//! CHECKPOINT_REF_PREFIX, MAX_CHECKPOINT_FILE_COUNT, MAX_CHECKPOINT_TOTAL_BYTES,
//! RESUME_MD_REPO_PATH, clearLastCheckpointResult, getLastCheckpointResult,
//! performRateLimitCheckpoint, useRateLimitCheckpointResult
//! ```
//!
//! # What is ported here
//!
//! All of it, as of SC-02's close:
//!
//! * the byte-exact `RESUME.md` renderer [`render_resume_md`] (`K4v`
//!   @292206132) and its todo-line sanitiser [`sanitize_todo_line`] (`Zsl`
//!   @292197365);
//! * the four module constants, the trigger vocabulary and the complete
//!   14-value skip-reason taxonomy `getLastCheckpointResult` persists;
//! * the git executor [`run_checkpoint`] (`q4v` @292197916) with its whole
//!   safety envelope;
//! * the once-per-session latch and telemetry wrapper
//!   [`perform_rate_limit_checkpoint`] (`z4v` @292197753), plus
//!   [`last_checkpoint_result`] / [`clear_last_checkpoint_result`].
//!
//! The executor's envelope, step for step (every one of these is a `skipReason`
//! rather than an error, because each one means "this repository is not one we
//! may write into"):
//!
//! ```text
//! gate  Vs("allow_local_checkpoint_commit"); skip when non-interactive / remote workspace
//! stat  git root and git dir must both be canonically contained (`Qsl`), the
//!       git dir must have no `commondir`, and none of objects/refs/refs/<ns>/
//!       logs/logs/refs/logs/refs/<ns>/packed-refs/reftable — nor any entry of
//!       objects/ — may be a symlink
//! env   GIT_COMMON_DIR, GIT_WORK_TREE, GIT_ALLOW_PROTOCOL=none, GIT_NO_LAZY_FETCH=1,
//!       GIT_NO_REPLACE_OBJECTS=1, GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0, and a PRIVATE
//!       GIT_INDEX_FILE (`<gitdir>/lingxi-checkpoint-index.<pid>`) so the user's
//!       own index is never touched
//! skip  sparse checkout (core.sparseCheckout=true), LFS / `filter=lfs` in
//!       .gitattributes, an in-progress sequencer (MERGE_HEAD, CHERRY_PICK_HEAD,
//!       REVERT_HEAD, BISECT_LOG, rebase-merge, rebase-apply), no HEAD
//! build read-tree HEAD -> ls-files -z --cached + ls-files -z -o --exclude-standard
//!       -> per-path lstat (paths containing \n, \r, `"`, `\` or a `.`/`..`
//!       segment are dropped; non-files dropped; uncontained realpaths dropped;
//!       mode 100755 when the owner-execute bit is set, else 100644) under the
//!       25 000-path and 2 GiB caps -> hash-object -w --no-filters --stdin-paths
//!       -> update-index --add --index-info (+ --force-remove for vanished cached
//!       paths) -> write-tree -> commit-tree -p HEAD
//! ref   update-ref --no-deref under core.logAllRefUpdates=false, then append
//!       `/<RESUME_MD_REPO_PATH>` to info/exclude and GC sibling checkpoint refs
//!       older than STALE_CHECKPOINT_REF_AGE
//! ```
//!
//! # Divergences, all of them
//!
//! * **Rebrand.** `refs/claude/checkpoint-` -> [`CHECKPOINT_REF_PREFIX`],
//!   `.claude/RESUME.md` -> [`RESUME_MD_REPO_PATH`], the commit author is
//!   `LingXi <noreply@lingxi.local>`, the commit subject is
//!   `WIP: LingXi rate-limit checkpoint (<sid8>)`, and the private index file is
//!   `lingxi-checkpoint-index.<pid>`. Every one of these names a LingXi
//!   artefact, so keeping the upstream spelling would have this feature write
//!   `refs/claude/*` into the user's repository.
//! * **`Vs("allow_local_checkpoint_commit")`** is a MANAGED-POLICY permission
//!   check upstream (`Vs` @283688009 returns `true` unless enterprise policy
//!   names the feature) — so upstream commits into the user's repository by
//!   default. The port has no feature-permission registry, so the gate is an
//!   explicit [`CheckpointGates::policy_allows`] input;
//!   [`CheckpointGates::default`] keeps upstream's polarity, while the live
//!   call site reads [`local_checkpoint_commit_allowed`]. See
//!   [`ALLOW_LOCAL_CHECKPOINT_COMMIT_ENV`] — that default is the one open
//!   PRODUCT decision here, and it is the only thing standing between this
//!   module and upstream behaviour.
//! * **No per-subprocess timeout.** [`GIT_TIMEOUT_MS`] is transcribed for the
//!   day the port grows a process runner with one; `std::process` has none.
//!   Every invocation is made local-only and non-interactive by
//!   `GIT_ALLOW_PROTOCOL=none` + `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0`, and the whole call is
//!   fire-and-forget on a detached thread, so a hung `git` costs one thread and
//!   a private index file — never the user's own index.
//! * **Telemetry.** `usage_limit_checkpoint_commit` /
//!   `tengu_rl_checkpoint_a1_shown` are not emitted; the `session` crate has no
//!   `telemetry` dependency. Both spellings live in [`CheckpointSkipReason`] /
//!   [`CheckpointTrigger`] so wiring an emitter later needs no new vocabulary.
