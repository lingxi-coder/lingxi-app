//! Skill subsystem abstraction (M8-P8): the [`Skill`] data model, the
//! [`SkillRegistry`] with trigger-based discovery, the markdown frontmatter
//! loader, MCP-derived skill builders, and the EXPERIMENTAL_SKILL_SEARCH
//! skill-discovery [`prefetch`] service (register-but-disable, default OFF).
//!
//! Extracted from the former monolithic `skills` crate. The model-visible
//! `Skill` *tool* lives in `tool-skill` (P7); compiled-in builtin skill
//! templates + their registration entry points live in the [`builtin`] module
//! (folded in from the former `skill-builtin` crate). This crate is the shared
//! skill abstraction — the skill analogue of `tool-api`.
//!
//! See spec §18 for the Skill subsystem overview.
