//! Local-bash task handler — M2 implementation.
//!
//! Spawns a `bash -c "<command>"` child through the [`Sandbox`] +
//! [`ProcessRunner`] traits (the D2 / spec A1 sandbox-decision invariant) and
//! streams its captured stdout/stderr into the task's spool file, mirroring the
//! claude-code `LocalShellTask` lifecycle (`spawnShellTask` → `killTask`).
//!
//! ## One child, both streamed-to-spool and killable
//!
//! claude-code's `LocalShellTask` owns a single `ShellCommand`: the SAME process
//! whose output streams to disk (`shellCommand.background(taskId)`) is the one
//! `killTask` later signals (`shellCommand.kill()`). There is no second child;
//! `background()` only transitions the already-running process — it does not
//! re-execute the command (`LocalShellTask.tsx` / `killShellTasks.ts`).
//!
//! This handler mirrors that single-child invariant. [`crate::task_trait::Task`]
//! hands the handler a [`TaskContext`] carrying only `fs` + `runtime`; the
//! engine must not call `tokio::spawn` directly (D17), so the one child runs via
//! [`ProcessRunner::run`] inside a single `ctx.runtime.spawn(..)` worker future.
//! The captured [`ProcessOutput`] is appended to the spool via
//! `FileSystem::append_file_no_follow`.
//!
//! [`Task::kill`] terminates that exact child by cancelling the worker future
//! through [`RuntimeSpawner::cancel`] — the analogue of TS
//! `shellCommand.kill()`. Cancelling the worker drops the `run()` future, which
//! drops the platform `Child`; the foreground runner spawns with
//! `kill_on_drop(true)` (see `platforms/posix/src/process/runner.rs`), so the
//! drop sends `SIGKILL` to the real OS process. The in-flight `bash -c` is thus
//! authoritatively killed — not merely flagged. The worker-cancel record (the
//! [`BackgroundTaskHandle`] + the `runtime` that minted it) is captured at spawn
//! time because [`TaskContext`] is per-call and the synchronous
//! [`TaskHandle::cleanup`] closure receives no `ctx`. This is exactly the seam
//! the sibling [`crate::handlers::local_agent::LocalAgentHandler`] uses.
//!
//! There is deliberately NO [`ProcessRunner::spawn_background`] call: that would
//! launch a *second*, independent OS child (detached `setsid`, output to a
//! runner-private file) for one logical task — double-executing any
//! side-effecting command. The single `run()` child is the whole task.
