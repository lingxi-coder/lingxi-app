//! Per-type task handler stubs.
//!
//! Full implementations land in M2. The M1 stubs exist so dependents can
//! compile against the [`crate::Task`] trait surface.

/// Serializes every test in this crate that mutates the process-global
/// `LINGXI_CONFIG_DIR`.
///
/// `local_workflow_test` and `in_process_teammate_test` compile into the SAME
/// test binary and both point that variable at a throwaway dir. They used to
/// hold two SEPARATE mutexes (`ENV_LOCK` and `CLAIM_ENV_LOCK`), which is no
/// mutual exclusion at all: a teammate-claim test could swap the variable out
/// from under `workflow_runs_a_nested_name_from_user_workflows_dir` mid-run,
/// and that test then resolved its nested workflow against the wrong config
/// dir and failed with "could not resolve the nested workflow". Intermittent,
/// and it moved between tests as scheduling changed.
///
/// One lock, one variable. Poisoning is recovered rather than propagated so a
/// single failing test cannot cascade into every other holder.
