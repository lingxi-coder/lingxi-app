//! Task scheduling and tracking primitives.
//!
//! See spec §6.6 (Tasks subsystem). This crate provides:
//! - The polymorphic [`state::TaskState`] union (10 variants).
//! - The generic [`task_trait::Task`] handler interface.
//! - [`registry::TaskRegistry`] for tracking running tasks.
//! - [`output_manager::TaskOutputManager`] for sandboxed task spool files.
//! - Per-type task handlers under [`handlers`].

// Documentation debt, not a decision that docs do not matter: this crate had
// 56 undocumented public item(s) when `missing_docs` was measured across the
// workspace (2026-09-16). The lint stays `warn` at the workspace level so a NEW
// crate still inherits the requirement; this allow is scoped here so the debt
// is visible per crate and can be repaid one crate at a time by deleting this
// line.
#![allow(missing_docs)]
// Dead code kept visible, not swept: this crate had 2 item(s) rustc could
// reach from nothing when the workspace was measured (2026-09-16). The lint
// stays `warn` at the workspace level so a NEW crate still inherits it; this
// allow is scoped here so the count is per crate and repayable by deleting this
// line. This is the category where "named, computed, never wired" hides — some
// of these read like features that were built and never connected. Each wants a
// decision (delete, or wire), not a blanket deletion.

// `LOCAL_APP_BUILD_WORKFLOWS` (P-1.7 doc'd it as unable to delete this
// const because `engine-mobile`'s `local_app_build_workflow_sets_agree`
// twinned it against `tool_workflow::LOCAL_APP_BUILD_WORKFLOWS`) is gone as
// of P-1.9: this crate's own guards already read a task's typed
// `scope::LocalAppWorkflowTaskScope` instead of a workflow-name string (see
// `registry::TaskRegistry::find_nonterminal_local_app_workflows` and
// `handlers::local_workflow::requires_workspace_lease`), and the ONLY other
// reader was that twin-agreement test, so there is no second list left
// anywhere to twin this crate's (deleted) list against.
//
// NOTE: an earlier version of this comment additionally claimed
// `tool_workflow::BuiltinWorkflowDescriptor` carries a typed
// `is_local_app_build` field/method answering the same question over there.
// It does not (`tools/workflow/src/builtins.rs`'s descriptor has only
// `name`/`description`/`script`/`manual_only`); no such symbol exists
// anywhere in the tree. Do not resurrect that claim without a grep proving
// the symbol first.
