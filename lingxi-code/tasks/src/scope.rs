//! Typed Local App workflow authority (design §18 Phase -1 step 8).
//!
//! # The problem this type replaces
//!
//! Three things used to derive Local App authority from a workflow's NAME:
//! `registry.rs`'s `find_nonterminal_local_app_workflows` (delete guard) and
//! `handlers/local_workflow.rs`'s `requires_workspace_lease` both asked "is
//! `workflow_id` a member of this crate's (now-deleted) `LOCAL_APP_BUILD_WORKFLOWS`?",
//! and `tool-workflow` asked the same question of `meta.name` to pick a
//! `workflowModel` default. A `workflow_id`/`meta.name` is a string a
//! *caller* supplies when launching a workflow -- so any custom workflow
//! that happens to reuse one of those names got the same answer as the
//! real one. The first two now read a scope instead; `tool-workflow`'s
//! `workflowModel` default (P-1.9, design §18 Phase -1 step 9) is now keyed
//! on the resolved SCRIPT's identity against
//! `tool_workflow::BuiltinWorkflowDescriptor::is_local_app_build`, which a
//! caller-supplied name cannot spoof either.
//!
//! [`LocalAppWorkflowTaskScope`] is the replacement authority token: the Host
//! (the composition binding that just resolved a real `LocalAppPluginBinding`
//! handle) mints one by calling the constructor for the capability slot it
//! actually resolved, and the guards read the scope instead of a name.
//!
//! # What this type guarantees
//!
//! 1. **Every construction path is a purpose constructor.** The only ways to
//!    obtain a value are [`LocalAppWorkflowTaskScope::for_build`],
//!    [`LocalAppWorkflowTaskScope::for_use_test`] and
//!    [`LocalAppWorkflowTaskScope::for_mcp_authoring`]. There is no
//!    `Default`, no `From`/`FromStr`/`TryFrom`, no `Deserialize` (see below),
//!    no public field and no `&mut` accessor, and both fields are private --
//!    so no other module, in this crate or in any dependent crate, can mint a
//!    scope or edit one after the fact. The purpose is therefore always the
//!    one the Host chose, never one recovered from a string.
//! 2. **`app_id` is well formed.** Every constructor is fallible and rejects
//!    an `app_id` that does not match `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]{0,63}$` -- the same
//!    grammar `local_apps::ids::is_valid_app_id` enforces before an id is
//!    ever used in a path. `tasks` deliberately does NOT depend on
//!    `local-apps` for this (see `MIRRORED GRAMMAR` below), so the check is a
//!    local copy of a 6-line predicate, not a shared type.
//!
//! # What this type does NOT guarantee
//!
//! **Ownership.** Well-formedness is not provenance. `for_build("victim")`
//! succeeds for any well-formed id, including one belonging to somebody
//! else's app, and the type has no way to know which app the caller is
//! entitled to. Design §8.1 requires that a custom workflow get nothing
//! "即使伪造 `meta.name` 或 `args.app_id`" -- the `meta.name` half is closed
//! by construction (guarantee 1); the `args.app_id` half is the **Host's**
//! obligation, and this type cannot discharge it. Passing `args.app_id`
//! straight into a constructor hands a hostile app the victim's lease and
//! delete guard, and nothing in this module will notice.
//!
//! What the Host owes is not "never let the string originate in `args`" --
//! the app id has to be named somewhere, and a
//! `LocalAppPluginBinding` handle names a WORKFLOW, not an app. What it owes
//! is that the id be one it RESOLVED rather than one it was told: before
//! minting, the Host must have established from its own state that the id
//! names a real, fully scaffolded app whose materialized manifest and binding
//! authorize exactly the workflow that is about to run, and that the script
//! is that workflow rather than something wearing its name. `engine-mobile`'s
//! `apply_materialized_local_app_collections_with_identity` is the seam that
//! does this and the only production mint today; its comment at the
//! constructor call enumerates the checks that stand between `args` and this
//! type.
//!
//! It also does not guarantee the id names an app that exists, or that the
//! app is in a state where the purpose makes sense. Those are lookups, and
//! lookups belong to whoever holds the store.
//!
//! # serde surface
//!
//! [`LocalAppWorkflowTaskScope`] implements `Serialize` and **not**
//! `Deserialize`, and that asymmetry is deliberate:
//!
//! - `Serialize` is legitimate: persisting a task's scope alongside its state
//!   is what step 8 asks for, and writing a scope out cannot create authority
//!   that did not already exist.
//! - `Deserialize` would be a public, name-accepting constructor. A
//!   `#[derive(Deserialize)]` ignores field privacy: it builds the struct
//!   from any `{"app_id": …, "purpose": …}` object, which is exactly the
//!   "authority from a caller-supplied string" this type exists to remove,
//!   and it does so invisibly -- the derive is one word and has no call site
//!   to review. Routing it through a validating `#[serde(try_from = …)]`
//!   does not rescue it either: the only thing such a conversion can check is
//!   the grammar above, and a forger supplies a perfectly well-formed victim
//!   id. Validation would buy nothing and would advertise a safety it does
//!   not have.
//!
//! So the read direction is left as a compile error on purpose. When a
//! persistence seam that reads scopes back actually exists, restore
//! explicitly AT that seam -- `#[serde(skip)]` the field and have the Host
//! re-mint the scope from the binding it resolves on load, or give the store
//! module its own named wire struct whose conversion says out loud whose
//! bytes it trusts. Adding `Deserialize` back here instead would silently
//! undo guarantee 1 for every present and future holder.
//! The test `scope_type_does_not_implement_deserialize` below pins this.
//!
//! [`LocalAppWorkflowPurpose`] keeps `Deserialize`: a purpose on its own
//! carries no authority (it names no app), and the store side needs to read
//! the discriminant back. It is the *pair* that is authority.
//!
//! # MIRRORED GRAMMAR
//!
//! `local_apps::ids::is_valid_app_id` is the original. `tasks` does not take
//! a PRODUCTION dependency on `local-apps`: both crates classify as `engine`
//! so `scripts/check_deps.py` would permit the edge, but `local-apps` pulls
//! bundled SQLite, vendored libgit2 and two tree-sitter grammars into
//! `tasks`, and `tasks` has five dependents (including `cron` and
//! `coordinator`, which build none of that today) for what is a six-line
//! predicate. The copy is pinned by the test
//! `app_id_grammar_matches_the_local_apps_corpus` below, whose corpus is
//! the one from `local_apps::ids`'s own tests.
//!
//! A DEV-dependency is a different tradeoff: `check_deps.py` excludes
//! dev-dependencies from its edge check, so it costs the five dependents
//! nothing, and it lets `app_id_grammar_agrees_with_local_apps_ids` call the
//! real `local_apps::ids::is_valid_app_id` directly instead of trusting that
//! the copied corpus above was transcribed correctly -- so `tasks/Cargo.toml`
//! carries that dev-dependency and both tests run.
//!
//! # Scope of this module
//!
//! This module only introduces the type. The two `tasks` call sites above now
//! read a scope, which reaches a task row through
//! [`crate::task_trait::TaskSpawnInput::LocalWorkflow`]'s `scope` field;
//! `tool-workflow`'s `workflowModel` default still keys on the name (design
//! §18 Phase -1 step 9).
