//! Emitted (CC 2.1.207 helper `oeg`) whenever a gitignore-style pattern fails
//! to compile at one of the ignore-consuming sites — the pattern is then
//! treated as matching nothing. The payload is `{ site }`, drawn from CC's
//! `neg` map: `claudemd_rule_globs`, `skill_paths`, `file_suggestions_ignore`,
//! `worktreeinclude`.
//!
//! These are NOT added to the count-locked `ALL_EVENT_NAMES` / `tengu_events.json`
//! fixture (that snapshot is from an OLDER claude event set; adding an entry
//! would break the byte-parity length lock). They live here for string-lock
//! testing only, mirroring [`crate::tengu::workflow`].
