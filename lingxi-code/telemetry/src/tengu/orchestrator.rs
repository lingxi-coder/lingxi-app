//! Orchestrator-lifecycle events (M5-02).
//!
//! Three events fired by `ConversationOrchestrator::run_turn`:
//! - [`CONVERSATION_STARTED`] at the top of the turn loop.
//! - [`CONVERSATION_COMPLETED`] after `emit_end_turn`.
//! - [`CONVERSATION_FAILED`] on any `Err` return.
//!
//! Wire strings are byte-locked at v0.6.0. M5-04..M5-13 may add more event
//! constants to this same module (streaming, permission, hooks, session,
//! resume, repl) or split into sibling submodules; for M5-02 only the three
//! lifecycle markers live here.
