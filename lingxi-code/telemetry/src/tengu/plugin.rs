//! `tengu_plugin_*` event schemas (2.1.251 byte-alignment §20c).
//!
//! # ⚠️ SUBSTRATE ONLY — none of these 14 events is emitted anywhere yet
//!
//! This module defines names and payload shapes. **It has no production
//! emit site.** A repo-wide
//! `grep -rn --include='*.rs' -e 'tengu::plugin' -e 'tengu_plugin'` matches
//! only this file, `tengu/mod.rs`, and two test files: no crate outside
//! `telemetry` references the module at all. `ALL_EVENT_NAMES` has no
//! runtime consumer (only tests read it), so nothing misbehaves — but the
//! registry advertises 14 plugin events that cannot appear in any telemetry
//! stream, and §20c is therefore **OPEN, not closed**. Do not read the
//! registered names, the count-lock test, or the parity fixture as evidence
//! that plugin telemetry ships.
//!
//! The nearest miss is `tengu_plugin_uninstalled_cli`: the oracle's `LIn`
//! (@166666396) emits it on the line immediately before `QWn(se.orphans,P)`,
//! and `QWn` IS ported (as `uninstall_orphan_suffix`,
//! `apps/cli/src/commands/plugin_install.rs`) — the emit two statements
//! earlier was walked past. Wiring the emit sites is deliberately deferred
//! to a task that owns those call sites rather than guessed at from here.
//!
//! `tengu_plugin_enabled_for_session` is the flagship event (fired once per
//! loaded plugin, every session) and is fully traced against the oracle
//! below. Its four siblings that are ALSO fully traced
//! ([`NameCollisionPayload`], [`FolderShadowedPayload`], [`RenamedPayload`],
//! [`LoadFailedPayload`]) get their own payload structs; the remaining CLI
//! lifecycle events are registered by name only — minting a payload shape
//! from a guess rather than the actual call site risks locking in a wrong
//! wire shape (the §20b lesson from `tengu::mcp`'s `ToolsListedPayload`).
//!
//! ## The shared `_PROTO_*` / redacted identity fields
//!
//! Every identity-bearing event below spreads the oracle's `q1(name,
//! marketplace, …)` helper, which in turn spreads `y5t(name, marketplace,
//! …)`. Traced verbatim from the 2.1.251 binary:
//!
//! ```text
//! function y5t(e,t,r=null){
//!   let o=B1(e,t,r), u=h5t(o)||Wmt(e,t);
//!   return {
//!     plugin_id_hash: nk(e,t),
//!     plugin_scope: c(o),
//!     plugin_name_redacted: u ? e : Jw,
//!     marketplace_name_redacted: u && t ? t : Jw,
//!     is_official_plugin: j1(o),
//!   };
//! }
//! function q1(e,t,r=null){
//!   let o = yme(e,t) ?? t;
//!   return {
//!     _PROTO_plugin_name: e,
//!     ...(o && { _PROTO_marketplace_name: o }),
//!     ...y5t(e,t,r),
//!   };
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! So every one of these events carries BOTH the redacted/hashed fields the
//! byte-alignment doc named (`plugin_id_hash`, `plugin_name_redacted`,
//! `marketplace_name_redacted`) AND two raw, un-redacted `_PROTO_*` fields
//! (`_PROTO_plugin_name`, `_PROTO_marketplace_name`) the doc's §20c summary
//! did not call out — this is the crate's `PiiTagged` case exactly (routed to
//! privileged `BigQuery` proto columns, stripped by
//! [`crate::pii::strip_proto_fields`] for any sink that isn't proto-aware).
//! There is no shared Rust struct for this identity block: `#[serde(flatten)]`
//! and `#[serde(deny_unknown_fields)]` cannot be combined on the same
//! container (a hard serde restriction), and this module's convention
//! mandates `deny_unknown_fields` on every payload struct, so the six fields
//! are duplicated verbatim into each event that spreads them — matching the
//! oracle's actual (flattened) wire shape rather than nesting them under a
//! synthetic key.
//!
//! ## `enabled_via` — the byte-alignment doc's value set does not hold
//!
//! §20c lists `enabled_via (org-policy / auto_install / admin-install /
//! seed-mount)`. Traced to its producer (`zin`, called as `c(me)` at the
//! `tengu_plugin_enabled_for_session` call site):
//!
//! ```text
//! function zin(e,t,r){
//!   if(e.isBuiltin) return "default-enable";
//!   if(t?.has(e.name)) return "org-policy";
//!   if(e.installationPreference==="required"
//!      || e.installationPreference==="auto_install") return "admin-install";
//!   if(r.some(o=>e.path.startsWith(...))) return "seed-mount";
//!   return "user-install";
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! `auto_install` is an *input* (`installationPreference`) the function
//! *tests*, never an `enabled_via` *output* — the real five-member output set
//! is `default-enable` / `org-policy` / `admin-install` / `seed-mount` /
//! `user-install` (all consistently kebab-case, so [`EnabledVia`] uses a
//! single `rename_all = "kebab-case"` rather than per-variant renames).
