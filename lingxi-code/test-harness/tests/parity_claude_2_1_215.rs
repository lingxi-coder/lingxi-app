//! Parity **delta baseline** vs Claude Code 2.1.215.
//!
//! Unlike [`parity_claude_2_1_208`], this file does **not** own or pin the live
//! `platform_api::CLAUDE_CODE_VERSION` — the port's version-facing wave now tracks
//! 2.1.216. This is a historical capture of the real 2.1.215
//! native binary's observable CLI surface (root/agents/mcp/plugin `--help`),
//! recorded so audits diff against the CURRENT release instead of the stale
//! 2.1.198/2.1.208 fixtures. (An audit run against a 2.1.198 baseline is how a
//! whole review can come back half-false: fixes already on HEAD read as "gaps".)
//!
//! The fixtures were captured from
//! `~/.local/share/claude/versions/2.1.215 {--help, agents --help, mcp --help,
//! plugin --help}` (SHA-256 in the review notes). Each `*_pins_*` test asserts a
//! parity-relevant fact of that captured surface — a NEW flag/command that
//! appeared since the last pinned wave — and doubles as executable
//! documentation of the corresponding LingXi gap (noted inline).
