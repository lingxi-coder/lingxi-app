//! HISTORICAL fixture for the Claude Code 2.1.217 oracle.
//!
//! The LIVE version-facing pins moved to `parity_claude_2_1_220.rs` when the
//! parity target advanced. This file no longer asserts against
//! `traits::CLAUDE_CODE_VERSION` — pinning a live constant to a superseded
//! version is how a suite starts failing for being CORRECT, and the 2.1.216
//! audit demoted the 2.1.208 suite the same way.
//!
//! Kept because the DERIVATIONS are what matter and they are version-agnostic:
//! `AI_AGENT` is the version with dots turned into dashes, the WebFetch UA
//! embeds it verbatim. Those shapes are re-asserted here against a frozen
//! 2.1.217 string so a change to the derivation is caught even if the target
//! moves again.

/// The 2.1.217 `AI_AGENT` shape: dots become dashes.
