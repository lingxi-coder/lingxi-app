//! STUB.6 — faithful-stub audit + partition regression test.
//!
//! ROADMAP §7 quick-win 3: "lock the intentionally-stubbed commands as
//! correct-by-design + partition test. Prevents wasted implementation of
//! TS-stubbed commands."
//!
//! Among the slash commands the Rust port leaves on the shared
//! [`UnimplementedCommandHandler`], this test pins down the subset that is
//! **correct-by-design** — i.e. claude-code *itself* disables / hides /
//! feature-gates-OFF / ships a literal `name: 'stub'` for them — so the Rust
//! stub is **faithful**, not a parity gap. That set lives in
//! [`command_api::builtin_support::CORRECT_BY_DESIGN_STUBS`].
//!
//! CRITICAL boundary this test defends (the STUB.6 warning): it must NOT
//! mislabel **host-bound-deferred** commands — those that claude-code
//! IMPLEMENTS via an interactive TUI/JSX dialog or SDK control-request, which
//! the Rust port defers only for lack of host infra — as correct-by-design.
//! Those are a *different*, genuine-gap partition
//! ([`command_api::builtin_support::HOST_BOUND_DEFERRED_GAPS`]). The two sets
//! are asserted disjoint here so a future contributor cannot quietly move a
//! real (worth-implementing) command into the "faithful, leave-alone" bucket.
//!
//! The dynamic half of the test is the load-bearing regression guard: it
//! registers the **full** builtin command surface (every batch, exactly as the
//! CLI does) and asserts each correct-by-design name STILL dispatches to the
//! locked stub literal `"{name}: not implemented in v0.6.0 (M5)"`. If someone
//! turns a correct-by-design stub into a half-implementation (a handler that
//! returns anything else), this test fails — which is the whole point.
