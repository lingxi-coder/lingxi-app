//! `read_file_state` — the per-path read-state registry shared between the
//! orchestrator and the file tools.
//!
//! 1:1 port of claude-code's `readFileState` cache
//! (`FileReadTool.ts:1032` `readFileState.set(fullFilePath, {content,
//! timestamp, offset, limit})`). Each successful `Read` records the file's
//! decoded content, its floor-truncated mtime (in milliseconds, matching TS
//! `Math.floor(mtimeMs)`), and the `offset`/`limit` the read was performed
//! with. Future staleness guards (Edit/Write/NotebookEdit) and the Read
//! dedup path consume this registry.
//!
//! ## Byte-budgeted LRU (1:1 with `FileStateCache`)
//!
//! Backed by a byte-budgeted LRU matching claude-code's `FileStateCache`
//! (`utils/fileStateCache.ts`), constructed
//! `new LRUCache({ max, maxSize, sizeCalculation: n => Math.max(1,
//! Buffer.byteLength(n.content)) })`:
//! - `max` entries = `READ_FILE_STATE_MAX_ENTRIES` (`fileStateCache.ts:18`,
//!   `READ_FILE_STATE_CACHE_SIZE = 100`).
//! - `maxSize` bytes = `READ_FILE_STATE_MAX_BYTES` (`fileStateCache.ts:22`,
//!   `DEFAULT_MAX_CACHE_SIZE_BYTES = 16 * 1024 * 1024`).
//! - per-entry size = `entry.content.len().max(1)` (UTF-8 byte length, the Rust
//!   equal of `Math.max(1, Buffer.byteLength(content))`).
//! - MRU-promote on [`ReadFileStateLru::get`]; on [`ReadFileStateLru::set`],
//!   least-recently-used entries are evicted while the entry count exceeds
//!   `max` OR the accumulated bytes exceed `maxSize`. A lone entry larger than
//!   `maxSize` is retained (lru-cache never evicts the key it just set).
//!
//! Zero new dependency: a `HashMap` + monotonic recency counter (the cap is 100
//! entries, so the O(n) LRU scan on eviction is trivial and deterministic).
//!
//! DEFERRED follow-ups (separate file-tracking items, out of scope here): the
//! `dump()`/`load()` + `cloneFileStateCache` persistence used to snapshot
//! read-state into forked agents (`AgentTool/runAgent.ts:377`),
//! `mergeFileStateCaches` (timestamp merge), the `normalize(key)` path
//! normalization (Rust callers already pass canonicalized absolute keys — see
//! `tools/file/src/lib.rs`), and the `file_state_cache:{entries, bytes}`
//! telemetry.
//!
//! [`ReadFileStateLru::strip_seeded_from_context`] belongs to that deferred
//! group: it is the `Gxe(e,{stripSeededFromContext})` half of the clone seam
//! and therefore has NO caller yet. It is implemented and tested rather than
//! omitted so the seam does not have to re-derive the semantics — a named
//! pending consumer, not dead code.
