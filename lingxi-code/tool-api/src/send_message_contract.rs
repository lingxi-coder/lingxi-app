| `"worker"` | Any agent from `ListAgents` — subagent, another local Claude session |
| `"worker [3fa9c1]"` | Same, plus its `[ref]` — only when a listing or an error shows one |

Your plain text output is NOT visible to other agents — to communicate, you MUST call this tool. Messages from teammates are delivered automatically; you don't check an inbox. Refer to agents by name — names keep working after an agent completes (a send resumes it from its transcript). Use the raw `agentId` (format `a...-...`) from its spawn result only when the agent has no name, or when a newer agent took the name (latest wins). When relaying, don't quote the original — it's already rendered to the user.

## Cross-session

Use `ListAgents` to discover targets. Every row leads with the agent's `name [ref]` — the name IS the address; there is no separate address syntax.

```json
{"to": "worker", "message": "check if tests pass over there"}
{"to": "worker [3fa9c1]", "message": "you, specifically"}
```

Send the bare name — a name that exactly matches one live agent or session (on this machine, on another machine, or in the cloud) delivers directly. Append the ` [ref]` only when the bare name is not enough — `ListAgents` shows two rows with it, or an error asks you to disambiguate (you typed only a prefix, or a session list could not be checked). A ref you did not just read from a listing or an error will not resolve, and if the same name also names an in-process agent, the bare name always wins — use the in-process one.

A listed peer is alive and will process your message; messages enqueue and drain at the receiver's next tool round (its `ListAgents` row says whether it is busy or idle right now). Your message arrives wrapped as `<cross-session-message from="...">`. **To reply to an incoming message, copy its `from` attribute as your `to`.** Cross-session messages travel between SESSIONS: if you are a subagent, your send goes out under your parent session's address, and any reply is delivered to the parent session's conversation, not to you.

To hear when a session ON THIS MACHINE finishes what it is doing, pass `notify_when_idle: true` (from the main conversation only) — one-shot and opt-in: exactly one `[Cross-session idle notice]` arrives when it next goes idle (or exits) — shown to you, or only to your user when this session holds peer messages for approval (the tool result says which); if it never signals within the subscription's lifetime (it may still be busy, may refuse inbound requests, or may have ended abruptly) the notice says the subscription expired instead. Omit `message` for a pure subscription that costs that session nothing; include one to deliver it now AND subscribe. Never poll `ListAgents` in a loop or send "are you done?" messages instead.

Permission boundaries are per-session: NEVER ask a peer to perform an action that was denied or blocked in your session, or that you expect your own permission settings would block — a peer doing it for you bypasses the user's permission decision (cross-session permission laundering). Route blocked work back to your user instead."###
