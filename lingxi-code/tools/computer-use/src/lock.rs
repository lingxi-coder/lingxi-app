//! Cross-session `computer` tool lock (parity with the binary's
//! `cu_lock_held` gate + `wrapper.tsx`'s `formatLockHeld`): only one Lingxi
//! process may drive the computer at a time. A single well-known lock file
//! (NOT per-session — the whole point is exclusion ACROSS sessions) holds
//! the PID of whichever process currently owns it.
//!
//! A lock is "held" only while that PID is still alive, so a crashed or
//! exited session's lock is automatically treated as free by the very next
//! process that checks it — no explicit release/turn-end hook is needed for
//! correctness (release is still attempted best-effort when a session ends
//! cleanly, purely so a fresh session doesn't pay the stale-PID detection
//! cost). Mirrors `apps/cli`'s `daemon_lock` module's PID-liveness pattern,
//! simplified: no daemon-cmdline/start-time recycled-PID guard, since a
//! computer-use holder is just an ordinary interactive session, not a
//! specifically-spawned daemon subcommand — `tools/*` also cannot depend on
//! `apps/cli` (crate-layering: tools never depend on apps), so this is a
//! self-contained rebuild of just the primitive this crate needs.
