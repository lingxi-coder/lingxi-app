/// Before 2.1.212 (and in LingXi's prior guard) a read done WITH `offset`/

/// editing a file previously read with offset/limit now succeeds when the file
/// is unchanged on disk.

/// ## Edit-applies recovery (`zQi`) lives in the caller
/// claude-code's Edit path additionally recovers a stale read when the edit
/// still applies cleanly to the current content. LingXi keeps that in
/// `edit.rs` (`stale_edit_applies`, gated on the CONTENT-CHANGED error — and
/// currently held shut there for a reason worth reading), so
/// this shared guard — reused verbatim by Write / NotebookEdit, which have no
/// such recovery — stays limited to the entry / mtime / full-read checks.
///
/// Arguments:
/// - `map`: the shared `read_file_state` registry (`ctx.read_file_state`).
/// - `canon`: the canonicalized absolute path used as the registry key (the
///   same key the `Read` tool wrote under).
/// - `current_mtime_ms`: the file's *current* floor-truncated mtime (ms).
/// - `current_full_content`: the file's *current* content, decoded the SAME
///   way `Read` stores it (so the content-equality fallback compares like with
///   like). Only consulted for the full-read fallback.
///
/// Returns `Ok(())` to proceed, or a [`tool_api::tool_trait::ToolError::InvalidInput`]
/// carrying the byte-exact error string when the write must be refused.
///
/// New-file creation MUST NOT call this — callers gate it behind "the file
/// exists" (TS `ENOENT → result:true` / `meta === null` skips the guard).
///
/// # `isPartialView`
/// claude-code's `wMe` also short-circuits on `isPartialView`. LingXi now
/// TRACKS that flag (`ReadFileEntry::is_partial_view`), and
/// [`read_covers_full_file`] honours it, so the guard is byte-faithful for
/// every entry that sets it — notably the memory files seeded by
/// `ConversationOrchestrator::seed_memory_read_state`, whose recorded content
