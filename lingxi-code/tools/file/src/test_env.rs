//! Test-only guard for the process-global env vars this crate's tools read.
//!
//! `glob.rs` and `grep.rs` both read `LINGXI_GLOB_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`, and they
//! live in the SAME test binary, so their tests run on concurrent threads
//! against one process environment. `glob.rs` had a mutex and cleared the var;
//! `grep.rs` mutated it with no lock at all. The result was a load-dependent
//! failure where `grep`'s test set the var to `5`, `glob`'s helper removed it
//! in between, and the next assertion read the 60s WSL default instead.
//!
//! Two rules this crate learned the hard way and encodes here:
//!
//! 1. EVERY user of a shared resource takes the SAME lock — not every mutator,
//!    and not a different lock that happens to be nearby.
//! 2. A process-global mutated under a lock must be RESTORED before the lock is
//!    released. Holding a lock while mutating is only half the invariant: a
//!    mutation that outlives the critical section just serializes the
//!    corruption.
