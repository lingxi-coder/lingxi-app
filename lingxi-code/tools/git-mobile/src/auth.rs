//! In-process credential callback + CA wiring for the network git ops
//! (clone / fetch / pull), spec §G3 (auth) + §G6 (TLS/CA).
//!
//! The HTTPS token is supplied in-memory by the Kotlin host and installed into
//! libgit2's `RemoteCallbacks::credentials` only for the duration of a network
//! call (borrowed for the `FetchOptions` lifetime). It NEVER reaches disk, a
//! child process, argv, or an environment variable: libgit2 is in-process, so
//! there is no exec boundary to cross. The token is also never logged.
//!
//! ## TLS backend: mbedTLS (Android), CA store wiring
//!
//! libgit2 is built against **mbedTLS** for the Android target (the OpenSSL
//! Rust glue was removed in M-a). CA trust is configured at runtime by pointing
//! libgit2's mbedTLS stream at Android's system CA directory
//! (`/system/etc/security/cacerts`) via [`set_ca_location`]. This works because
//! this libgit2 version wires `GIT_OPT_SET_SSL_CERT_LOCATIONS` for the mbedTLS
//! backend too (not only OpenSSL): the option routes to
//! `git_mbedtls__set_cert_location(file, path)` in
//! `streams/mbedtls.c`, which loads a whole directory of hashed PEM certs with
//! `mbedtls_x509_crt_parse_path(path)` and installs them as the trust chain via
//! `mbedtls_ssl_conf_ca_chain`. No `streams/mbedtls.c` patch is required.
//!
//! Verification is **fail-closed (verify-required equivalent)**. The mbedTLS
//! config uses `MBEDTLS_SSL_VERIFY_OPTIONAL` *only* so libgit2 can still read
//! the peer certificate after the handshake (REQUIRED frees it on failure); the
//! stream's `verify_server_cert` then re-checks `mbedtls_ssl_get_verify_result`
//! and returns `GIT_ECERTIFICATE` on any failure. For HTTPS we install **no**
//! `certificate_check` callback (see [`make_network_callbacks`], which only adds
//! one for SSH host-key pinning), so libgit2's `httpclient.c` propagates that
//! `GIT_ECERTIFICATE` as a hard connection failure — there is no path that
//! accepts an unverified cert. This is identical to libgit2's OpenSSL backend
//! contract; we do NOT weaken the verify mode.
//!
//! ## `forbid(unsafe_code)` carve-out
//!
//! The crate is `#![deny(unsafe_code)]` (NOT `forbid`) for two audited reasons,
//! both libgit2 process-global setters that the vendored `git2` exposes as
//! **`unsafe`** (they mutate a libgit2 global without synchronization):
//!
//! 1. [`set_ca_location`] — `git2::opts::set_ssl_cert_dir` over
//!    `GIT_OPT_SET_SSL_CERT_LOCATIONS`. The spec (G6) assumed a safe
//!    `set_ssl_cert_locations`; the pinned `git2 0.21` instead splits it into
//!    `unsafe` setters (still required under mbedTLS).
//! 2. [`ensure_ssh_homedir`] — `git2::opts::set_homedir` over
//!    `GIT_OPT_SET_HOMEDIR`, so libssh2 can expand `~/.ssh/known_hosts` on
//!    Android (no `HOME`); without it SSH fails closed before host-key pinning.
//!
//! Each `unsafe` block is localized under `#[allow(unsafe_code)]`; the rest of
//! the crate keeps the deny lint, so no other unsafe can slip in.
