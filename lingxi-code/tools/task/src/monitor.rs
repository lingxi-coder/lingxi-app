//! `MonitorTool` — the background-process event-monitor tool (binary `EVp`/`bVp`,
//! name `IA = "Monitor"`).
//!
//! Arms a background monitor on a shell `command`; in the binary each stdout line
//! becomes a live `TaskNotification` (token-bucket rate-limited, with suppression),
//! bounded by `timeout_ms` (default 5m, max 1h) unless `persistent`.
//!
//! **Gated off by default.** `isEnabled = Eq() && mu()` where
//! `Eq() = nt("tengu_amber_sentinel", false)` (no live GrowthBook → false) and
//! `mu()` = shell-available. So the tool is registered-but-disabled (invisible to
//! the model), byte-identical to the shipped binary — exactly like `PushNotification`.
//!
//! The implementation preserves the public static surface — name,
//! `description()`/`prompt()` (both `cJr + lJr()`, the latter the `Yke()`-gated
//! PushNotification splice), the input/output schemas, `isEnabled`, permission,
//! descriptor — and dispatches a real registry-backed monitor. The task runner
//! streams stdout lines into rate-limited live notifications, spools stderr only,
//! and remains addressable through `TaskOutput` / `TaskStop`.

- **One per occurrence, indefinitely** ("tell me every time an ERROR line appears") → Monitor with an unbounded command (`tail -f`, `inotifywait -m`, `while true`).
- **One per occurrence, until a known end** ("emit each CI step result, stop when the run completes") → Monitor with a command that emits lines and then exits.

Your script's stdout is the event stream. Each line becomes a notification. Exit ends the watch.

  # Each matching log line is an event
  tail -f /var/log/app.log | grep --line-buffered "ERROR"

  # Each file change is an event
  inotifywait -m --format '%e %f' /watched/dir

**Don't use an unbounded command for a single notification.** `tail -f`, `inotifywait -m`, and `while true` never exit on their own, so the monitor stays armed until timeout even after the event has fired. For "tell me when X is ready," "#;
/// The same choice again, in the "unbounded command" warning.
const CJR_UNBOUNDED_BACKGROUND: &str = r#"use Bash `run_in_background` with an `until` loop instead (one notification, ends in seconds)"#;
const CJR_UNBOUNDED_FOREGROUND: &str = r#"use a foreground Bash `until` loop instead"#;
const CJR_TAIL: &str = r#". Note that `tail -f log | grep -m 1 ...` does *not* fix this: if the log goes quiet after the match, `tail` never receives SIGPIPE and the pipeline hangs anyway.

**Script quality:**
- Every pipe stage must flush per line or matches sit in its buffer unseen: `grep` needs `--line-buffered`, `awk` needs `fflush()`. `head` cannot flush at all — `| head -N` delivers nothing until N matches accumulate, then ends the stream.
- In poll loops, handle transient failures (`curl ... || true`) — one failed request shouldn't kill the monitor.
- Poll intervals: 30s+ for remote APIs (rate limits), 0.5-1s for local checks.
- Write a specific `description` — it appears in every notification ("errors in deploy.log" not "watching logs").
- Only stdout is the event stream. Stderr goes to the output file (readable via Read) but does not trigger notifications — for a command you run directly (e.g. `python train.py 2>&1 | grep --line-buffered ...`), merge stderr with `2>&1` so its failures reach your filter. (No effect on `tail -f` of an existing log — that file only contains what its writer redirected.)

**Coverage — silence is not success.** When watching a job or process for an outcome, your filter must match every terminal state, not just the happy path. A monitor that greps only for the success marker stays silent through a crashloop, a hung process, or an unexpected exit — and silence looks identical to "still running." Before arming, ask: *if this process crashed right now, would my filter emit anything?* If not, widen it.

  # Wrong — silent on crash, hang, or any non-success exit
  tail -f run.log | grep --line-buffered "elapsed_steps="

  # Right — one alternation covering progress + the failure signatures you'd act on
  tail -f run.log | grep -E --line-buffered "elapsed_steps=|Traceback|Error|FAILED|assert|Killed|OOM"

For poll loops checking job state, emit on every terminal status (`succeeded|failed|cancelled|timeout`), not just success. If you cannot confidently enumerate the failure signatures, broaden the grep alternation rather than narrow it — some extra noise is better than missing a crashloop.

**Output volume**: Every stdout line is a conversation message, so the filter should be selective — but selective means "the lines you'd act on," not "only good news." Never pipe raw logs; filter to exactly the success and failure signals you care about. Monitors that produce too many events are automatically stopped; restart with a tighter filter if this happens.

Stdout lines within 200ms are batched into a single notification, so multiline output from a single event groups naturally.

The script runs in the same shell environment as Bash. Exit ends the watch (exit code is reported). Timeout → killed. Set `persistent: true` for session-length watches (PR monitoring, log tails) — the monitor runs until you call TaskStop or the session ends. Use TaskStop to cancel early."#;

const WS_DESCRIPTION: &str = r#"
**ws source** — open a WebSocket and stream each incoming text frame as an event. No shell, no polling: the server pushes, you get notified.

  Monitor({
    ws: {url: 'wss://events.example.com/stream', protocols: ['v1']},
    description: 'deploy events',
  })

Each text frame becomes one notification (multiline frames stay as one event). Binary frames are reported as `[binary frame, N bytes]` rather than passed through. Socket close ends the watch with the close code surfaced; errors are surfaced before close. Same rate limiting as bash — a firehose will be suppressed and eventually stopped, so subscribe to a filtered feed where one exists.

Prefer this over `command: 'websocat wss://…'` — it avoids the extra process and line-buffering pitfalls. Use bash when you need to transform or filter frames with shell tools before they become events."#;
