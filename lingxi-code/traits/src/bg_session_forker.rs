//! `BgSessionForker` — the injected seam behind the 2.1.212 `/fork` (`vAd`):
//! copy the CURRENT conversation into a NEW BACKGROUND session while the
//! interactive session stays live.
//!
//! The redefined `/fork` (`vAd = "Copy this conversation into a new background
//! session and keep working here"`) has NO `load` in the binary — upstream's
//! special dispatcher intercepts `name === "fork"` and routes it through the
//! background (`--bg`/daemon) session-copy path. This engine mirrors that split
//! with an injected seam: [`crate::OrchestratorHandle::fork_to_background_session`]
//! reads the live session's history + rendered system prompt and calls this
//! trait; the concrete impl lives in the CLI composition root (which owns the
//! `--bg`/daemon dispatch machinery and mints the new short id), so the leaf
//! `orchestrator` crate never depends on `apps/cli` (correct layering — mirrors
//! the existing `fork_spawner`/`fork_budget` optional-seam on the handle).
//!
//! The impl SNAPSHOTS the passed conversation into the new background session's
//! `<config-home>/projects/<sanitize(cwd)>/<new-uuid>.jsonl` transcript (the
//! same on-disk shape the resume loader reads), then dispatches a detached
//! daemon worker that RESUMES that copy. It returns the system line the LIVE
//! session displays — the composition root owns that text because it alone
//! knows the newly-minted background short id.
