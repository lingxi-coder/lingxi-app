//! IDE bridge transport abstraction.
//!
//! The engine talks to an IDE-side bridge (VS Code / `JetBrains` plugin, or
//! any other host) through a `WebSocket`-shaped duplex transport. The concrete
//! transport (Tokio `WebSocket`, in-memory loopback, etc.) lives in a platform
//! crate. The engine receives an `Arc<dyn BridgeTransport>` and never touches a
//! concrete socket directly.
//!
//! See spec §29 (IDE Bridge) and D17 (Runtime boundary).
