//! Slash-command dispatch surface — implemented by `lingxi-commands`,
//! called by `lingxi-orchestrator` and the CLI binary.
//!
//! Introduced by M5-09 (commands surface). The trait lives here in
//! `lingxi-traits` so the orchestrator and CLI can depend on the dispatch
//! abstraction without pulling in `lingxi-commands` directly.
