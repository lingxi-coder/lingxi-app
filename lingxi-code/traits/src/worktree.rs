//! Git worktree management abstraction.
//!
//! Engine code receives an `Arc<dyn WorktreeManager>` so subagents that need
//! isolated working copies (e.g. parallel coding tasks) can create one without
//! the engine depending on git directly. Platform crates provide concrete
//! implementations; on platforms without git the manager reports
//! [`is_supported`](WorktreeManager::is_supported) as `false` and subagents
//! degrade gracefully — see [`crate::worktree::WorktreeError::Unsupported`].
//!
//! See spec §10.7 (Worktree degradation policy).
