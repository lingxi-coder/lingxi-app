//! Backend-neutral `computer` tool `request_access` prompt bridge types.
//!
//! Mirrors [`crate::ask_user_question_bridge`]: a pure-data description of
//! the request plus a one-shot reply channel the TUI fills when the user
//! resolves the widget. The `computer`-tool-owned `ComputerAccessResolver`
//! (in `tool-computer-use`) constructs a [`ComputerAccessExchange`], sends it
//! to the TUI app, and awaits the response on `resp_tx` — the same round-trip
//! `ask_user_question_bridge::AskUserQuestionExchange` performs, chosen over
//! reusing the GENERIC `permission_bridge::PermissionExchange` because a
//! title+message+options-list prompt can't express per-app checkboxes, a
//! tier, three independent capability flags, or a TCC missing-permissions
//! panel — parity target: claude-code's `ComputerUseApproval.tsx`.
//!
//! Backend-neutral so both the `tool-computer-use` producer and the `tui`
//! renderer can share these shapes without either depending on the other.
