//! Worktree creation policy with graceful degradation.
//!
//! [`create_worktree_or_degrade`] implements the matrix from spec §10.7:
//! `Required` agents fail when worktrees are not supported, `Optional`
//! agents try to create one and log a warning on failure, and `None`
//! agents skip worktrees entirely.

/// Try to create a worktree for the agent identified by `slug`, applying
/// the policy from `requirement`:
///
/// * `Required` + unsupported → [`WorktreeError::Unsupported`].
/// * `Required` + supported → propagate the manager's result.
/// * `Optional` + supported → create one; on error, log and return `Ok(None)`
///   so the caller can fall back to in-place execution.
/// * `Optional` + unsupported or `None` → `Ok(None)`.
