"""No tracked symlink may point at an absolute path.

WHY THIS EXISTS. Twice in one session a worktree symlink — created so the
worktree could reuse the primary checkout's 20MB-per-ABI build inputs instead of
rebuilding them — ended up COMMITTED, because:

  1. the ignore rules that were supposed to cover those paths were written with a
     trailing slash (`Generated/`, `app/src/main/jniLibs/`), which matches a
     DIRECTORY ONLY, so a symlink at the same path slipped past and surfaced as
     untracked; and
  2. a broad `git add apps/` then swept it into the index.

The blob that lands is mode 120000 whose content is an absolute path on one
machine. For `apps/android/native/app/libs` the target was its own checked-out path,
so checking it out replaced the real build inputs with a self-referential link
and every tree walk afterwards died with ELOOP — `check-brand-leaks.sh` stopped
reporting and started crashing, which masked 21 real findings until the loop was
removed.

Discipline did not prevent the second occurrence: the ignore rules were already
fixed for Android, the lesson was already written down, and it still happened on
the iOS path an hour later. So this is a gate rather than a rule.

An absolute symlink is never correct in this repository: it cannot survive a
clone, a fresh worktree, or another machine. A RELATIVE symlink is fine and is
left alone.
